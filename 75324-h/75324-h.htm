  <h2 class='c009'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>There are many histories of Israel, but this is
the first attempt to write one from a purely
archæological point of view. During the last
few years discovery after discovery has come
crowding upon us from the ancient East, revolutionising
all our past conceptions of early
Oriental history, and opening out a new and unexpected
world of culture and civilisation. For
the Oriental archæologist Hebrew history has
ceased to stand alone; it has taken its place
in that great stream of human life and action
which the excavator and decipherer are revealing
to us, and it can at last be studied like the
history of Greece or Rome. The age of the
Patriarchs is being brought close to us; our
museums are filled with written documents
which are centuries older than Abraham; and
we are beginning to understand the politics which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>underlie the story of the Pentateuch and the
causes of the events which are narrated in it.</p>

<p class='c003'>Over against the facts of archæology stand
the subjective assumptions of a certain school,
which, now that they have ceased to be predominant
in the higher latitudes of scholarship,
are finding their way into the popular literature
of the country. Between the results of Oriental
archæology and those which are the logical end
of the so-called ‘higher criticism’ no reconciliation
is possible, and the latter must therefore be
cleared out of the way before the archæologist
can begin his work. Hence some of the pages
that follow are necessarily controversial, and it
has been needful to show why the linguistic
method of the ‘literary analysis’ is essentially
unscientific and fallacious when applied to history,
and must be replaced by the method of historical
comparison.</p>

<p class='c003'>Even while my book has been passing through
the press, a new fact has come to light which
supplements and enforces the conclusion I have
drawn in the second chapter from a comparison
of the account of the Deluge in the book of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>Genesis with that which has been recovered from
the cuneiform inscriptions. At the recent meeting
of the Oriental Congress in Paris, Dr. Scheil
stated that among the tablets lately brought
from Sippara to the museum at Constantinople
is one which contains the same text of the story
of the Flood as that which was discovered by
George Smith. But whereas the text found by
George Smith was written for the library of
Nineveh in the seventh century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>, the newly-discovered
text was inscribed in the reign of
Ammi-zadok, the fourth successor of Khammurabi
or Amraphel, in the Abrahamic age. And
even then the text was already old. Here and
there the word <i>khibi</i>, ‘lacuna,’ was inserted, indicating
that the original from which it had
been copied was already illegible in places.
Since this text agrees, not with the ‘Elohist’
or the ‘Yahvist’ separately, but with the supposed
combination of the two documents in the
book of Genesis, it is difficult to see, as the
discoverer remarked, how the ‘literary analysis’
of the Pentateuch can be any longer maintained.
At all events, the discovery shows the minute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>care and accuracy with which the literature of
the past was copied and handed down. Edition
after edition had been published of the story
of the Deluge, and yet the text of the Abrahamic
age and that of the seventh century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> agree
even to the spelling of words.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is the ‘higher critics’ themselves, and not
the ancient writers whom they criticise, that are
careless or contemptuous in their use of evidence.
In the preface to my <i>Higher Criticism and the
Verdict of the Monuments</i> I have referred to a
flagrant example of their attempt to explain
away unwelcome testimony. Here it was the
inscription on an early Israelitish weight, which
was first pronounced to be a forgery, then to
have been misread, and finally to have been
engraved by different persons at different times!
The weight is now in the Ashmolean Museum
in Oxford, to which it was presented by Dr.
Chaplin, and the critics have conveniently forgotten
the dogmatic assertions that were made
about it. They have, in fact, been busy elsewhere.
Cuneiform tablets have been found
relating to Chedorlaomer and the other kings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>the East mentioned in the fourteenth chapter
of Genesis, while in the Tel el-Amarna correspondence
the King of Jerusalem declares that
he had been raised to the throne by the ‘arm’
of his god, and was therefore, like Melchizedek,
a priest-king. But Chedorlaomer and Melchizedek
had long ago been banished to mythland,
and criticism could not admit that archæological
discovery had restored them to actual history.
Writers, accordingly, in complacent ignorance of
the cuneiform texts, told the Assyriologists that
their translations and interpretations were alike
erroneous, that they had misread the names of
Chedorlaomer and his allies, and that the ‘arm
of the Mighty King,’ in the letters of Ebed-Tob,
meant the Pharaoh of Egypt. Unfortunately,
the infallibility of the ‘critical’ consciousness can
be better tested in the case of Assyriology than
in that of the old Hebrew records, and the
Assyriologist may therefore be pardoned if he
finds in such displays of ignorance merely a
proof of the worthlessness of the ‘critical’
method. A method which leads its advocates
to deny the facts stated by experts when these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>run counter to their own prepossessions cannot
be of much value. At all events, it is a method
with which the archæologist and the historian
can have nothing to do.</p>

<p class='c003'>This, indeed, is tacitly admitted in a modern
German work on Hebrew history, which is more
than once referred to in the following pages.
Dr. Kittel’s <i>History of the Hebrews</i> is partly
filled with an imposing ‘analysis’ of the documents
which constitute the historical books of
the Old Testament, and we might therefore
expect that the history to which it forms an
introduction would be influenced throughout by
the results of the literary disintegration. But
nothing of the sort is the case. So far as Dr.
Kittel’s treatment of the history is concerned,
the ‘analysis’ might never have been made; all
that it does is to prove his acquaintance with
modern ‘critical’ literature. The history is
judged on its own merits without any reference
to the age or character of the ‘sources’ upon
which it is supposed to rest. The instinct
of the historian has been too strong for the
author to resist, and the results of the linguistic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>analysis have accordingly been quietly set
aside.</p>

<p class='c003'>But history also has its canons of evidence,
and criticism, in the true sense of the word, is
not confined to the philologists. There is no infallible
history any more than there is infallible
philology; and if we are to understand the history
of the Hebrews aright, we must deal with it as
we should with the history of any other ancient
people. The Old Testament writers were
human; and in so far as they were historians,
their conceptions and manner of writing history
were the same as those of their Oriental contemporaries.
They were not European historians
of the nineteenth century, and to treat them as
such would be not only to pursue a radically
false method, but to falsify the history they have
recorded. No human history is, or can be,
inerrant, and to claim inerrancy for the history
of Israel is to introduce into Christianity the
Hindu doctrine of the inerrancy of the Veda.
For the historian, at any rate, the questions
involved in a theological treatment of the Old
Testament do not exist.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>The present writer, accordingly, must be
understood to speak throughout simply as an
archæologist and historian. Theologically he
accepts unreservedly whatever doctrine has been
laid down by the Church as an article of the
faith. But among these doctrines he fails to find
any which forbids a free and impartial handling
of Old Testament history.</p>

<p class='c003'>Perhaps it is necessary to apologise for the
multitude of unfamiliar proper names which make
the first chapter of this book somewhat difficult
reading. But they represent the archæological
discoveries of the last few years in their bearing
upon the history of the Patriarchs, and an
attempt has been made to lighten the burden of
remembering them by repeating the newly-discovered
facts, at all events in outline, wherever
it has been needful to allude to them.
Those, however, who find the burden too heavy
and wearisome may pass on to the second chapter.</p>

<p class='c004'>The historian of the Hebrews is met at the very outset by a
strange difficulty. Who were the Hebrews whose history
he proposes to write? We speak of a Hebrew people, of a
Hebrew literature, and of a Hebrew language; and by the one
we mean the people who called themselves Israelites or Jews,
by the other the literary records of this Israelitish nation, and
by the third a language which the Israelites shared with the
older population of Canaan. It is from the Old Testament
that we derive the term ‘Hebrew,’ and the use of the term
is by no means clear.</p>

<p class='c003'>Abram is called ‘the Hebrew’ before he became Abraham
the father of Isaac and the Israelites. The confederate of the
Amorite chieftains of Mamre, the conqueror of the Babylonian
invaders of Canaan, is a ‘Hebrew’; when he comes before us
as a simple Bedâwi shêkh he is a Hebrew no longer. When
Joseph is sold into Egypt it is as a ‘Hebrew’ slave; and he
tells the Pharaoh that he had been ‘stolen’ out of ‘the land
of the Hebrews.’ The oppressed people in the age of the
Exodus are known as ‘Hebrews’ to their Egyptian taskmasters.
Moses was one of ‘the Hebrews’ children’; and he declares to
the Egyptian monarch that Yahveh of Israel was ‘the God of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>the Hebrews.’ It would seem, therefore, as if it were the
name by which the people of Canaan, and more especially
the Israelites, were known to the Egyptians.</p>

<p class='c003'>And yet there is no certain trace of it on the Egyptian
monuments. In the Egyptian texts the south of Palestine is
called Khar, perhaps the land of the ‘Horites’; the coast-land
is termed Zahi, ‘the dry’; and the whole country is indifferently
known as that of the Upper Lotan or Syrians, and of the
Fenkhu or Phœnicians. When we come down to the age of
the nineteenth dynasty we find the name of Canaan already
established in Egyptian literature. Seti <abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> destroyed the Shasu
or Bedâwin from the frontiers of Egypt to ‘the land of
Canaan’; and in a papyrus of the same age we hear of Kan’amu
or ‘Canaanite slaves’ from the land of Khar. Of any name
that resembles that of the Hebrews there is not a trace.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is equally impossible to discover it in the cuneiform
records of Babylonia and Assyria. The Babylonians, from
time immemorial, called Palestine ‘the land of the Amorites,’
doubtless because the Amorites were the dominant people
there in those early ages when Babylonian armies first made
their way to the distant West. The Assyrians called it ‘the
land of the Hittites’ for the same reason, while in the letters
from the Asiatic correspondents of the Pharaoh found at Tel
el-Amarna, and dating from the century before the Exodus, it
is termed Kinakhna or Canaan. How then comes Joseph to
describe it as ‘the land of the Hebrews,’ and himself as a
‘Hebrew’ slave?</p>

<p class='c003'>More than one attempt has been made to identify the
mysterious name with names met with in hieroglyphic and
cuneiform texts. The Egyptian monuments refer to a class
of foreigners called ’Apuriu, who were employed in the time
of the nineteenth and twentieth dynasties to convey the blocks
of stone needed for the great buildings of Egypt from the
quarries of the eastern desert. We are told how they dragged
the great altar of the Sun-god to Memphis for Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>; and
how, at a much later date, Ramses <abbr title='the fourth'><span class='fss'>IV.</span></abbr> was still employing eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>hundred men of the same race to transport his stone from the
quarries of Hammamât. Chabas and some other Egyptologists
have seen in these ’Apuriu the Hebrews of Scripture, and
have further identified them with the ’Aperu mentioned on
the back of a papyrus, where it is said that one of them acted
as a sort of aide-de-camp to the great conqueror of the
eighteenth dynasty, Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr></p>

<p class='c003'>But there are serious objections to these identifications.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
There are reasons for believing that the ’Aperu and the
’Apuriu do not represent the same name; and no satisfactory
explanation has hitherto been forthcoming as to why we should
meet with Hebrews of the Israelitish race still serving as
public slaves in Egypt so long after the Exodus as the reigns
of Ramses <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> and Ramses <abbr title='the fourth'><span class='fss'>IV.</span></abbr> Moreover, in one text it is
stated that the ’Apuriu belonged ‘to the ’Anuti barbarians,’
who inhabited the desert between Egypt and the Red Sea.
It is true that some of the Semitic kinsfolk of the Israelites
led a nomad life here in the old times, as they still do to-day;
nevertheless, ‘the ’Anuti barbarians’ were for the most part
of African origin, and the eastern desert of Egypt is not quite
the place where we should expect to find the nearest kindred
of a Canaanitish people. At present, at all events, the
identification of Hebrews and ’Apuriu must be held to be
non-proven.</p>

<p class='c003'>Since the discovery of the cuneiform tablets of Tel el-Amarna
another attempt has been made to find the name of
the Hebrews outside the pages of the Old Testament. Ebed-Tob,
the vassal-king of Jerusalem, in his letters to Khu-n-Aten,
the ‘heretic’ Pharaoh of the eighteenth dynasty, speaks of
certain enemies whom he terms Khabiri. They were threatening
the authority of the Egyptian monarch, and had already
captured several of the cities under Ebed-Tob’s jurisdiction.
The Egyptian governors in the south of Palestine had been
slain, and the territory of Jerusalem was no longer able to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>defend itself. If the Pharaoh could send no troops at once,
all would be lost. The Khabiri, under their leader Elimelech,
were already established in the country, and in concert with
the Sutê or Bedâwin were wresting it out of the hands of
Egypt.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Some scholars, with more haste than discretion, have pronounced
the Khabiri of the cuneiform tablets to be the
Hebrews of the Old Testament. If that were the case,
Hebrew and Israelite could no longer be considered to be
synonymous terms. In the age of the Khabiri the Israelites
of Scripture were still in Egypt, where the cities of Ramses
and Pithom were not as yet built, and their leader to the
conquest of Canaan was Joshua, and not Elimelech. When
in subsequent centuries Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> and Ramses <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> invaded
and occupied Palestine, they found no traces there of the
children of Israel. They have left us lists of the places they
captured; we look in vain among them for the name of Israel
or of an Israelitish tribe. We look equally in vain in the Book
of Judges for any allusion to Egyptian conquests.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Khabiri, then, are not the Hebrews of Scripture, nor
does the word throw any light on the term ‘Hebrew’ itself.
Khabiri is really a descriptive title, meaning ‘Confederates’;
it was a word borrowed by Babylonian from the language of
Canaan, but is met with in old Babylonian and Assyrian
hymns.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> It may be that Hebron, the city of ‘the Confederacy,’
derived its name from these ‘Confederated’ bands;
at all events, the name of Hebron is nowhere mentioned by
Ebed-Tob or his brother governors, and it first appears in the
Egyptian records in the time of Ramses <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> under the form
of Khibur.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>The Tel el-Amarna tablets, accordingly, give us no help in
regard to the name of the Hebrews, nor do any other cuneiform
inscriptions with which we are acquainted. Babylonian
records do indeed speak of a people called the Khabirâ, but
they inhabited the mountains of Elam, on the eastern side of
Babylonia, and between them and the Hebrews of Scripture
no connection is possible.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> In an old Babylonian list of
foreign countries we read of a country of Khubur, which was
situated in northern Mesopotamia in the neighbourhood of
Harran; but Khubur is more probably related to the river
Khabur than to the kinsfolk of Terah and Laban.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Moreover,
a part of the mountains of the Amanus, overlooking the
Gulf of Antioch, from whence logs of pine were brought to
the cities of Chaldæa, was also known as Khabur.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Archæological discovery, therefore, has as yet given us no
help. We must still depend upon the Old Testament alone
for an answer to our question, Who were the Hebrews? And,
unfortunately, the evidence of the Old Testament is by no
means clear. We have seen that on one side by the Hebrews
are meant the Israelites, and that from time to time the
Israelitish descendants of Abraham are characterised by that
name. But on the other side there are passages in which a
distinction seems to be made between them. Though Joseph
is a Hebrew slave, it is because he has been stolen out of ‘the
land of the Hebrews.’ Canaan, accordingly, even before its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>conquest by the Israelites, was inhabited by a Hebrew people.
So, too, in the early days of the reign of Saul, the Israelites and
the Hebrews appear to be still separate. While ‘the men of
Israel’ hide themselves in caves and thickets, ‘the Hebrews’
cross over the Jordan to the lands of Gad and Gilead (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr>
<abbr title='thirteen'>xiii.</abbr> 6, 7). Similarly we are told that in Saul’s first battle with
the Philistines ‘the Hebrews’ that were with the enemy
deserted to ‘the Israelites’ that were with Saul (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr>
<abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 21).</p>

<p class='c003'>Perhaps, however, all that is intended in these passages is
to emphasise the fact that among the Philistines, as among
the Egyptians, the children of Israel were known as ‘Hebrews.’
The difficulty is that such a name is not found in the monumental
records of Egypt. When Shishak describes his
campaign against Judah and Israel, it is not the Hebrews,
but the Fenkhu and the ’Amu whom he tells us he has
conquered.</p>

<p class='c003'>In fact, the Egyptian equivalent of Hebrew is ’Amu. What
Joseph calls ‘the land of the Hebrews’ would have been
termed ‘the land of the ’Amu’ by an Egyptian scribe. Joseph
himself would have been an ’Amu slave. ’Amu signified an
Asiatic in a restricted sense. It denoted the Asiatics of Syria
and of the desert between Palestine and Egypt. It included
also the nomad tribes of Edom and the Sinaitic Peninsula.
It was thus larger in its meaning than the Biblical ‘Hebrew’;
but, at the same time, it conveyed just the same ideas, and was
used in much the same way. The Hyksos conquerors of
Egypt were termed ’Amu, and a famous Syrian oculist in the
days of the eighteenth dynasty is described as an ’Amu of
Gebal. The name is probably derived from the Canaanitish
and Hebrew word which signifies ‘a people.’</p>

<p class='c003'>The name ‘Hebrew’ comes from a root which means ‘to
pass’ or ‘cross over.’ It has been variously explained as ‘a
pilgrim,’ ‘a dweller on the other side,’ ‘a crosser of the river.’
But the second explanation is that which best harmonises with
philological probabilities. We find other derivatives from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>same root. Among them is Abarim, the name of that mountain-range
of Moab on ‘the other side’ of the Jordan, from
whence Moses beheld the Promised Land (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-seven'>xxvii.</abbr> 12),
as well as Ebronah, near the Gulf of Aqaba, one of the resting-places
of the children of Israel (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-three'>xxxiii.</abbr> 34). Hebrew
genealogists indeed seem to have connected the name with
that of the patriarch Eber. But this is in accordance with that
spirit of Semitic idiom which throws geography and ethnology
into a genealogical form. It is probable that the name of the
patriarch is merely the Babylonian <i>ebar</i>, ‘a priest,’ which is
met with in Babylonian contracts of the age of Abraham.</p>

<p class='c003'>Professor Hommel, however, supplementing a suggestion of
Dr. Glaser, has recently drawn attention to certain facts which
throw light on the early use of the name ‘Hebrew,’ even if
they do not remove all the difficulties connected with it.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> A
Minæan inscription from the south of Arabia, in which the
name of ’Ammi-zadoq occurs, couples together the countries
of Misr or Egypt, of Aashur, the Ashshurim of <abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-five'>xxv.</abbr> 3,
and of ’Ibr Naharân, ‘the land beyond the river.’ In another
Minæan inscription of the same age, the name of ’Ibr
Naharân is replaced by that of Gaza. It is clear, therefore,
that in ’Ibr Naharân we must see the south of Palestine. But
the Minæan texts are not alone in their use of the term. A
broken Assyrian tablet from the library of Nineveh<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> also refers
to Ebir-nâri, ‘the land beyond the river,’ in Canaan, and
associates it with Beth-el, Tyre, and Jeshimon. Professor
Hommel is probably right in assigning the inscription to the
reign of Assur-bel-Kala, the son of Tiglath-pileser <abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> (<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>
1080). At all events, the name seems to be of Babylonian
origin, like most of the geographical expressions adopted by
the Assyrians, and it is consequently very possible that Ebir-nâri
primarily signified the country on the western bank of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Euphrates, where Ur was situated, and that it was subsequently
extended to the country west of the Jordan when Syria became
a province of the Babylonian empire.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>However this may be, the question with which we started
remains unanswered. We are still unable to define with
exactness who the Hebrews were. The origin and first use
of the name are still a matter of doubt. We must be content
with the fact that it came to be applied—if not exclusively, at
all events predominantly—to the people of Israel in their
dealings with their foreign neighbours. It may be that this
special application of it was first fixed by the Philistines. In
any case it was a name which was accepted by the Israelites
themselves, and gradually became synonymous with all that
was specifically Israelitish. Even the old ‘language of
Canaan,’ as it is still called by Isaiah (<abbr title='nineteen'>xix.</abbr> 18), became ‘the
Hebrew language’ of modern lexicographers. For us of to-day
the history of the Hebrew people means the history of the
descendants of Israel. It is with ‘Abram the Hebrew’ that
the history begins. Future ages looked back upon him as the
ancestor of the Hebrew race, ‘the rock’ from whence it was
‘hewn.’ He had come from the far East, from ‘Ur of the
Casdim’ or Babylonians. His younger brother Haran had
died ‘in the land of his nativity’; with his elder brother
Nahor and himself, his father Terah had migrated westward,
to Harran in Mesopotamia. There Terah had died, and there
Abram had received the call which led him to journey still
further onwards into the land of Canaan.</p>

<p class='c003'>He was already married. Already in Babylonia he had
made Sarai his wife, who is also said to have been his step-sister;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>while the wife, Milcah, whom his brother Nahor had
taken to himself, was his niece. A time came when both
Abram and Sarai took new names in token of the covenant
they had made with God. Abram became Abraham, and
Sarai became Sarah.</p>

<p class='c003'>Upon these beginnings of Hebrew history light has been
thrown by the decipherment of the cuneiform inscriptions.
The site of ‘Ur of the Chaldees’ has been found. Geographers
are no longer dependent on Arab legends or vague coincidencies
with classical names. Ur was one of the most ancient
and prosperous of Babylonian cities. The very name meant
‘the city’; it was, in fact, the capital of a district, and its kings
at one time had claimed sway over the rest of Chaldæa.
Alone among the great cities of Babylonia, it stood on the
western bank of the Euphrates in close contact with the
nomad tribes of Semitic Arabia. More than any other of the
Babylonian towns it was thus able to influence and be influenced
by the Semites of the west; it was an outpost of
Babylonian culture, and its position made it a centre of
trade.</p>

<p class='c003'>Its mounds of ruin are now known as Muqayyar or Mugheir.
Highest among them towers the mound which covers
the remains of the great temple of the moon-god. For it was
to Sin, the moon-god, that the city had been dedicated from
time immemorial, and in whose honour its temple had been
built. There was only one other temple of Sin that was equally
famous, and this was the temple which stood at Harran in
Mesopotamia, and which, like that at Ur, had been erected
and endowed by Babylonian kings.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was not only with the Semites of Northern Arabia that
Ur carried on its trade. It lay not very far from the mouth
of the Euphrates, which in early days flowed into the Persian
Gulf nearly a hundred miles to the north of the present coast.
We hear in the cuneiform tablets of ‘the ships of Ur,’ and
these ships must have been used in the trade that was carried
on by water. The products of Southern Arabia could thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>be brought to the Chaldean city; perhaps also there was
intercourse even with Egypt.</p>

<p class='c003'>The kings of Ur grew in power, and a dynasty arose at
last which gained ascendency over the other states of Babylonia.
We are beginning to learn something about these
kings and the society over which they ruled. During the last
few years excavations have been carried on by the Americans,
by the French, and even by the Turkish Government, which
have brought to light thousands of early cuneiform records,
some of which are dated in their reigns. A large proportion
of these records are contracts which throw an unexpected
light on the commerce and law, the manners and customs and
social life of the inhabitants of Babylonia at the time.</p>

<p class='c003'>Among the last kings of the dynasty of Ur were Inê-Sin
and Pûr-Sin, whose names, it will be observed, are compounded
with that of the patron-god of the state. Inê-Sin not only
invaded Elam, but the distant west as well. His daughters
married the High-Priests both of Ansan in Elam and of
Markhasi, now Mer’ash, in Syria.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> But it was not the first
time that Babylonian armies had marched to the west.
Centuries before (about <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 3800) another Babylonian king,
Sargon of Accad, had made campaign after campaign against
the land of the Amorites, as Syria and Palestine were called,
had set up images of himself on the shores of the Mediterranean,
and had united all Western Asia into a single empire,
while his son and successor had marched southward into the
Sinaitic Peninsula.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> A predecessor of Inê-Sin himself, Gimil-Sin
by name, had overrun the land of Zabsali, which Professor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Hommel is probably right in identifying with Subsalla, from
whence an earlier Babylonian prince obtained stone for his
buildings, and which, we are told, was in the mountains of
the Amorites. The stone, in fact, was the limestone of the
Lebanon.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Inê-Sin married his daughter to the High-Priest of Zabsali,
but his successor Pûr-Sin <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> appears to have been one of the last
of the dynasty. Babylonia fell under Elamite domination, and
a line of kings arose at Babylon whose names show that they
came from Southern Arabia. The first of them was Khammu-rabi,
whose reign lasted for fifty-five years. He proved himself
one of the most able and vigorous of Babylonian monarchs.
Before he died he had driven the Elamites out of the country,
and united it into a single monarchy, with Babylon for its
capital.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Khammu-rabi first mounted the throne, he was a
vassal of the king of Elam. In Southern Babylonia, not far
from Ur, though on the opposite side of the river, was a rival
kingdom, that of Larsa, whose king, Eri-Aku or Arioch, was
the son of an Elamite prince. His father Kudur-Mabug is
called ‘the Father of the land of the Amorites,’ implying not
only that Canaan was subject at the time to Elamite rule, but
also that Kudur-Mabug held some official position there. In
one of his inscriptions Eri-Aku entitles himself ‘the shepherd
of Ur,’ and tells us that he had captured ‘the ancient city of
Erech.’</p>

<p class='c003'>In Eri-Aku or Arioch, Assyriologists have long since seen
the Arioch of the book of Genesis, the contemporary of
Abram; and their belief has been raised to certainty by the
recent discovery by Mr. Pinches of certain fragmentary cuneiform
tablets in which allusion is made not only to Khammu-rabi,
but also to the kings who were his contemporaries.
These are Arioch, Kudur-Laghghamar or Chedor-laomer, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Tudghula or Tid’al. Khammu-rabi, accordingly, must be
identified with Amraphel, who is stated in the Old Testament
to have been king of Shinar or Babylonia, and we can approximately
fix the period when the family of Terah migrated from
Ur of the Chaldees. It was about 2300 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> if the chronology
of the native Babylonian historians is correct.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>There was at this time constant intercourse between Babylonia
and the West. The father of Eri-Aku, as we have seen,
bore the title of ‘Father of the land of the Amorites,’ and
Khammu-rabi himself claimed sovereignty over the same part
of the world. So, too, did his great-grandson Ammi-satana
(or Ammi-dhitana), who in one of his inscriptions adds the
title of ‘king of the land of the Amorites’ to that of ‘king of
Babylon.’ Indeed, the kings of the dynasty to which Khammu-rabi
belonged bear names which are almost as much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Canaanitish or Hebrew as they are South Arabic in form.
The Babylonians had some difficulty in spelling them, and in
the contract-tablets, consequently, the same name is written
in different ways. Thus we learn from a philological tablet
in which the names are translated into Semitic Babylonian
that Khammu and Ammi are but variant attempts to represent
the same word—that of a god whose name appears in those
of South Arabian princes as well as Israelites of the Old
Testament, and from whom the Beni-Ammi or Ammonites
derived their name.<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The founder of the dynasty had been Sumu-abi (or Samu-abi),
‘Shem is my father,’ and his son had been Sumu-la-il,
‘Is not Shem a god?’ The monarchs who ruled at Babylon,
therefore, when Abram was born claimed the same ancestor
as did Abram’s family, and worshipped him as a god. The
father of Ammi-satana was Abesukh, the Abishua’ of the
Bible; and his son was Ammi-zaduq, where <i>zaduq</i>, ‘righteous,’
is a word well known to the languages of Southern Arabia
and Canaan, but not to that of Babylonia. The kings who
succeeded to the inheritance of the old Babylonian monarchs
of Ur were thus allied in language and race to the Hebrew
patriarch.</p>

<p class='c003'>But this is not all. We find in the contracts which were
drawn up in the reigns of the kings of Ur and the successors
of Sumu-abi not only names like Sabâ, ‘the Sabæan,’ which
carry us to the spice-bearing lands of Southern Arabia,<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> but
names also which are specifically Canaanitish, or as we should
usually term it, Hebrew, in form. Thus Mr. Pinches has
discovered in them Ya’qub-il and Yasup-il, of which the
Biblical Jacob and Joseph are abbreviations, and elsewhere
we meet with Abdiel and Lama-il, the Lemuel of the Old
Testament. Even the name of Abram (Abi-ramu) himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>occurs among the witnesses to a deed which is dated in the
reign of Khammu-rabi’s grandfather, and its Canaanitish
character is put beyond question by the fact that he is called
the father of ‘the Amorite.’<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>From other documents we learn that there were Amoritish or
Canaanite settlements in Babylonia where the foreigner was
allowed to acquire land and carry on trade with the natives.
One of these was just outside the walls of Sippara in Northern
Babylonia, and a good many references to it have already been
detected. Thus in the reign of Ammi-zaduq a case of disputed
title was brought before four of the royal judges which related to
certain feddans or ‘acres’ of land ‘in the district of the Amorites,’
‘at the entrance to the city of Sippara’;<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> and a contract
dated in the reign of Khammu-rabi’s father further describes
the district as just outside the principal gate of the city. It
included arable and garden land, pasturage and woods, as well
as houses, and was thus like the land of Goshen, which was similarly
handed over to the Israelites to settle in. An Egyptian
inscription of the time of the eighteenth dynasty also speaks of
a similar district close to Memphis, which had been given to
the Hittites by the Pharaohs.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> The strangers had their own
judges. We learn, for instance, from a lawsuit which was
decided in the time of Khammu-rabi that a Canaanite, Nahid-Amurri
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>(‘the exalted of the Amorite god’), who was defendant
in a case of disputed property, was first taken, along with the
plaintiff, before the judges of Nin-Marki, ‘the lady of the
Amorite land,’ and then before another set of judges and
the assembled people of the city. It is clear from this that
the judges who were deputed to look after the interests of
the settlers from the West also acted when one of the parties
was a native of Babylonia.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The migration of Terah and his family thus ceases to be an
isolated and unexplained fact. In the age to which it belonged
Canaan and Babylonia were in close connection one
with the other. Babylonian kings claimed rule over Canaan,
and Canaanitish merchants were established in Babylonia.
The language of Canaan was heard in the Babylonian cities,
and even the rulers of the land were of foreign blood. Between
Babylonia and Canaan there was a highway which had
been trodden for generations, and along which soldiers and
civil officials, merchants and messengers, passed frequently to
and fro.</p>

<p class='c003'>Midway, on a tributary of the river Belikh, was the city of
Harran, so called from a Sumerian word which signified ‘a
high-road.’ Its name pointed to a Babylonian foundation,
as did also its temple dedicated to the Babylonian moon-god.
The temple, in fact, counted among its founders and restorers
a long line of Babylonian and Assyrian kings, and almost the
last act of the Babylonian Empire was the restoration of the
ancient shrine. Merodach, the god of Babylon, came in a
dream to the last of the Babylonian monarchs, and bade him
raise once more from its ruins the sanctuary of his brother-god.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>And Nabonidos tells us how he performed the task laid upon
him, how he disinterred the memorial-stones of the older
Assyrian kings, and how ‘by the art of the god Laban, the
lord of foundations and brickwork, with silver and gold and
precious stones, with spices and cedarwood,’ he built again
Ê-Khulkhul, ‘the temple of rejoicing.’ The moon-god, Sin,
who was adored within it, was known throughout the Aramaic
lands of Northern Syria as Baal-Kharran, ‘the Lord of Harran.’</p>

<p class='c003'>But there was another city of the moon-god besides Harran.
This was Ur in Babylonia. In Babylonian literature it is
commonly known as the city of Sin. Between Ur and Harran
there must have been some close connection, and it may be
that Harran owed its foundation to the kings of Ur. At all
events, there was good reason why an emigrant from Ur should
establish his abode in Harran. Both cities were under the
same divine patron, and that meant, in the ancient world, that
both lived the same religious and civil life. Harran obeyed
the rule of the Babylonian kings; its very name showed that
it was of Babylonian origin, and its culture was that of Babylonia.
Law and religion, manners and customs, all were alike
in Harran and Ur. The migration from the one city to the
other did not differ from a change of dwelling from London
to Edinburgh.</p>

<p class='c003'>The country in which Harran was built formed part of the
vast tract between the Tigris and Euphrates, which was known
to the Babylonians in early days as Suru or Suri, a name which
perhaps survived in that of the city Suru, the Suriyeh of modern
geography. In Semitic times it was called Subari or Suwari
by the Assyrians, sometimes also Subartu. Suru thus corresponded
with our Mesopotamia, though it seems to have
included a part of Northern Syria as well. But to the district
in which Harran stood the Babylonians gave a more special
name. It was Padan or Padin, ‘the cultivated plain,’ of which
it is said in a cuneiform tablet that it lies ‘in front of the
mountains of the Aramæans,’<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> while an early Babylonian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>sovereign entitles himself king of Padan as well as of Northern
Babylonia.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> The name bore witness to the fertility of the
country to which it was applied. The Babylonian lexicographers
make <i>padan</i> a synonym of words signifying ‘field’
and ‘garden’; it was, in fact, originally the piece of ground
which a yoke of oxen could plough in a given period of time.
Hence it came to mean an ‘acre,’ a sense which still survives
in the Arabic <i>feddân</i>. The Babylonian leases and sales of
land which were drawn up in the Abrahamic age repeatedly
describe the ‘feddans’ or ‘acres’ of which the property consists.
The fertile plain of Mesopotamia, accordingly, was not
a plain merely; it was also ‘the field’ or ‘acre’ of Aram
where the Semites of the Aramæan stock ploughed and harvested
their corn.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>In Egyptian its name was Naharina. The name had
been borrowed from the Aramæans, who called their country
the land of Naharain, ‘the two rivers.’ In Canaan, as we
know from the cuneiform tablets of Tel el-Amarna, it bore
the Canaanitish form of Naharaim, Nahrima, the final nasal
of the Aramaic dialects becoming <i>m</i>. Aram-Naharaim was
thus the Egyptian and Canaanitish title of the country which
the Babylonian spoke of as Padan Arman, ‘Padan of the
Aramæans.’ Both names go back to the age before the
Israelitish Exodus out of Egypt; the one belongs to Egypt
and Palestine, the other to Babylonia.</p>

<p class='c003'>Before the age of the Exodus, however, the Aramæan population
of Mesopotamia became the subjects of a people who
seem to have come from the north. Mitanni, on the eastern
bank of the Euphrates, not far from the modern Birejik,
became the capital of a kingdom which extended over
Naharaim on the one side, and to the neighbourhood of the
Orontes on the other. The race which founded the kingdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>spoke a language unlike any other with which we are acquainted;
it was, however, agglutinative, and exhibits certain
general resemblances to some of the languages of the Caucasus.
From the sixteenth century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> onwards, Mitanni and Naharaim
are synonymous terms, even though, at times, the Egyptian
scribes still observed the old distinction between them; even
though also, it may be, Naharaim had a larger meaning than
Mitanni. But the kings of Mitanni were vigorous and powerful.
In the age of the Tel el-Amarna correspondence we find
them intriguing with the Hittites and Babylonians in the
Egyptian province of Canaan, and Ramses <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> of the twentieth
Egyptian dynasty still counts the people of Mitanni among his
enemies. At an earlier date the royal families of Egypt and
Mitanni had intermarried with one another, and the marriages
had introduced new ideas and a revolutionary policy into the
ancient monarchy of the Nile. When the kingdom of Mitanni
had been founded we do not know. There is no trace of it
in the earlier records of Babylonia, and we may safely say
that it arose long after the era of Khammu-rabi and Abram.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Terah, we are told, died in Harran, and there Nahor, his
second son, remained to dwell. Terah and Nahor are names
which we look for in vain elsewhere in the Old Testament or
in the inscriptions of Babylonia. And yet light has been
thrown upon them by the cuneiform texts. Tablets have
been found in Cappadocia, written in archaic cuneiform
characters and in a dialect of Assyrian, which are at least as
old as the the of the Tel el-Amarna letters; according to some
scholars, they are coeval with the dynasty of Khammu-rabi.
In one of these tablets we find the word, or name, <i>Nakhur</i>;
what its signification may be, we cannot, unfortunately, tell;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>all we can be sure of is that it was known to the Semitic
inhabitants of eastern Cappadocia, not far from the Aramæan
border.<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> The name of Terah points in the same direction,
Tarkhu was a god whose name enters into the composition
of Cappadocian and North-Syrian princes; he was worshipped
by the Hittites, and so belongs to the same region as that in
which we have found the name of Nahor.</p>

<p class='c003'>But neither Tarkhu nor Nakhur is Aramaic in the usual
sense of the term. Both seem to belong to that mixed dialect
which has been revealed to us by German excavation at
Sinjerli, north of the Gulf of Antioch, and about which
scholars have disputed whether to call it Hebraised Aramaic
or Aramaised Hebrew. At any rate, it is a dialect which,
though Aramaic in origin, has been profoundly influenced by
‘the language of Canaan.’ It bears witness to the existence
of a Hebrew-speaking population in that part of the world.
It would be rash to affirm that this population already existed
there in patriarchal days, though words which seem to be of
Hebrew origin are met with in the Cappadocian tablets. But
we now know that Northern Syria was once the meeting-place
of the northern Semitic languages; that here they mingled
with one another and with other languages which were not
Semitic in type, and that here alone, outside the pages of the
Old Testament, are the names of Terah and Nahor to be
found.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Nahor remained in Harran, but Abram moved on still
further to the West. The road was well known to his contemporaries,
and probably followed the later line of march
which led past Carchemish, now Jerablûs, Aleppo, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Hamath. From Hamath southward the land was in the
possession of the Amorites. Their chief seat was immediately
to the north of the Palestine of later days, but they had
already occupied large portions of the territory to the south
of them as far as the Dead Sea and the limits of the cultivated
land. They had been for many centuries the dominant people
of the West. Already in the time of Sargon of Akkad they
had given their name among the Babylonians to Central
Syria and Canaan. The name, indeed, goes back to the pre-Semitic
days of Babylonian history. What the Semites called
the land of the Amurrâ or Amorites, the Sumerians had termed
Martu. And the two names, Amurrâ and Martu, continued
to designate Syria and Palestine almost to the latest epoch of
Babylonian political life.</p>

<p class='c003'>The monuments of Egypt have shown us what these
Amorites were like. They belonged to the blond race, like
the Libyans of Northern Africa. At Abu-Simbel their skins
are painted yellow—the Egyptian equivalent of white—their
eyes blue, and the beard and eyebrows red. At Medînet Habu
the skin, as Professor Flinders Petrie expresses it, is ‘rather
pinker than flesh-colour,’ while in a tomb of the eighteenth
dynasty at Thebes it is painted white, the eyes and hair being
a light red-brown. At Karnak the names of the places
captured by Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> in Palestine are surmounted by
the figures of Amorites whose skin is alternately red and
yellow, the red denoting sunburn, the yellow what we term
white. In features the Amorites belonged to the Indo-European
type. The nose was straight and regular, the
forehead high, the lips thin, and the cheek-bones somewhat
prominent, while they wore whiskers and a pointed beard. So
far as we can judge from the representations of the Egyptian
artists, they belonged to a dolichocephalic or long-headed
race.<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>That they were tall in stature we know from the Old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Testament. By the side of them the Hebrew spies described
themselves as grasshoppers. The cities they built were strong
and ‘walled up to heaven’; the thick walls of one of them have
been disinterred on the site of Lachish by Professor Petrie and
Mr. Bliss. But though the Babylonians continued to include
Canaan in the general term, ‘land of the Amorites,’ and spoke
of the Canaanite himself as an ‘Amorite,’ they nevertheless
came to know that there was a distinction between them. The
Babylonian king, Burna-buryas, whose letters to the Egyptian
Pharaoh have been found at Tel el-Amarna, distinguishes
Kinakhkhi or Canaan from the land of the Amorites, which had
come to be confined to the country immediately to the north
of Palestine. From the seventeenth century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> downwards,
Amorite and Canaanite cease to be synonymous terms. It is
only in certain parts of the Pentateuch that the old Babylonian
use of the name ‘Amorite’ still survives.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was a use that never prevailed among the Assyrians.
When Assyria became a kingdom, and its rulers first led their
armies to the West, the Amorites were no longer the dominant
power. Their place had been taken by the Hittites. And it
is the Khattâ or Hittites, therefore, who in the Assyrian
inscriptions, as distinguished from those of Babylonia, are the
representatives of Western Syria. On the Black Obelisk of
Shalmaneser <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, now in the British Museum, even Ahab of
Israel and Ba’asha of Ammon are included among the ‘kings
of the country of the Hittites.’ But of this Assyrian use of
the term Hittite there are slight, if any, traces in the Old
Testament.<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Abram, the Hebrew, first pitched his tent near the future
Shechem, under ‘the terebinth of Moreh.’ Moreh is the
Sumerian Martu, ‘the Amorite,’ in Hebrew letters; and the
fact gives point to the statement which follows immediately,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>that ‘the Canaanite’—and not the Amorite—‘was then in
the land’ (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='twelve'>xii.</abbr> 6). ‘The mountain of Shechem’ is mentioned
in an Egyptian papyrus which describes the travels of
an Egyptian officer in Palestine, in the fourteenth century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>,<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a>
but the book of Genesis represents the city as founded only in
the lifetime of Jacob (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-four'>xxxiv.</abbr> 6). Hence we are told
that it was to ‘the place’ or ‘site’ of Shechem that Abram
made his way, not to the town itself. And after the foundation
of the town its Canaanite inhabitants are still called Amorites,
in accordance with ancient Babylonian custom (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='forty-eight'>xlviii.</abbr>
22).</p>

<p class='c003'>We next find the Hebrew patriarch in Egypt. There was
famine in Canaan, and Egypt was already the granary of the
eastern world. In the Tel el-Amarna tablets we hear of
Egyptian corn being sent to the starving population of Syria;
and Meneptah, the son of the Pharaoh of the Exodus, tells us
that he had loaded ships with wheat for the Hittites when
they were suffering from a famine. The want of rain which
destroyed the crops of Canaan did not affect Egypt, where the
fertility of the soil depends upon the irrigating waters of the
Nile.</p>

<p class='c003'>Egypt at the time must have been under the sway of the
Hyksos kings. They were Asiatic invaders who had overrun
the country from north to south, and established themselves
on the throne of the Pharaohs. In three successive dynasties
did they govern the land, and the descendants of the native
monarchs sank into <i>hiqu</i> or vassal ‘princes’ of Thebes. At
first, it is said, they laid Egypt waste, destroying the temples and
massacring the people. But the influence of Egyptian culture
soon led them captive. The Hyksos court became Egyptianised;
the Hyksos king assumed the titles and state of the ancient
sovereigns; Sutekh, the Hyksos god, was identified with Ra,
the Sun-god of On, and the official language itself remained
Egyptian. A treatise on mathematics, one of the few scientific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>works that have survived the shipwreck of Egyptian literature,
was written under the patronage of the Hyksos king,
Apophis <abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr><a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Nevertheless, with all this outward varnish of Egyptian
culture, the Hyksos rule continued to be foreign. Even the
names of the kings were not Egyptian, and up to the last the
supreme object of their worship was a foreign deity. According
to the Sallier Papyrus, the war of independence was occasioned
by the demand of Apophis <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> that Sutekh, and not Amon,
should be acknowledged as the god of Thebes, and a scarab
found at Kom Ombos in 1896 bears upon it, in confirmation
of the story, the name of Sutekh-Apopi.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a> Moreover, the
Hyksos capital was not in any of the old centres of Egyptian
government. Zoan, it is true, now Sân, in the north-eastern
part of the Delta, was nominally their official residence; but
they preferred to dwell in the fortress of Avaris, on the extreme
eastern edge of Egypt, and within hail of their Asiatic kinsmen.
It was from Avaris that Apophis had sent his insolent message
to the terrified Prince of Thebes.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Hebrew visitor to Egypt, therefore, was among friends
and not strangers. Moreover, he had only to cross the
frontier to find himself in the presence of the Pharaoh’s
court. Whether at Zoan or at Avaris, it was alike close at
hand to the traveller from Asia.</p>

<p class='c003'>After leaving Egypt, Abram established himself at Hebron.
It would seem that the name of Hebron, ‘the Confederacy,’
was not yet in existence, as it was to the ‘terebinth’ of Mamre,
and not of Hebron, that Abram ‘removed his tent.’ Indeed,
it is more than doubtful whether Mamre and Hebron occupied
precisely the same site. It may be that Mamre was the older
fortress of the Amorites, whose place was taken in after times
by the town which gathered round the adjoining sanctuary of
Hebron.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>In any case, its population was Amorite, though probably
we should understand ‘Amorite’ here in its Babylonian sense.
‘Abram the Hebrew,’ it is declared, ‘dwelt under the terebinth
of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of
Aner; and these were confederate with Abram.’ In other
words, the Hebrew settler in Canaan had formed an alliance
with the native chiefs.</p>

<p class='c003'>Then came an event upon which the cuneiform records of
Babylonia are beginning to cast light. Chedor-laomer, king
of Elam, and the vassal kings Amraphel of Shinar, Arioch of
Ellasar, and Tid’al of ‘nations,’ marched against the five
Canaanitish princes of the Vale of Siddim at the northern
end of the Dead Sea, bent upon obtaining possession of the
naphtha springs that abounded there, and the produce of
which had already made its way to Babylonia. No resistance
was made to the invader; it is clear, in fact, that the invasion
was no new thing, and that the rest of Canaan was already
subject to the lords of the East. For ‘twelve years’ the five
Canaanitish kings ‘served Chedor-laomer, and in the thirteenth
year they rebelled.’ Once more, therefore, the forces of
Elam and Babylonia moved westward. The revolt, it would
appear, had spread to other parts of the ‘land of the Amorites,’
and the invading army marched southward along the eastern
side of the Jordan. First, the Rephaim were overthrown at
Ashteroth-Karnaim, in ‘the field of Bashan,’ as it was termed
in the days of the Tel el-Amarna tablets; then followed the
turn of the Zuzim in the future land of Ammon, and of the
Emim in what was to be the land of Moab; and after smiting
the Horites of Mount Seir, the invaders penetrated into the
wilderness of Paran, fell upon the desert sanctuary of Kadesh,
now called ’Ain el-Qadîs, and returned northward along the
western shore of the Dead Sea. They had thus partially
followed in the footsteps of an earlier Chaldæan king, Naram-Sin,
who centuries before had made his way to the Sinaitic
Peninsula, and there gained possession of the coveted copper-mines.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>The native princes in the Vale of Siddim were no match for
the foe. A battle was fought which ended disastrously for
the Canaanitish troops. The kings of Sodom and Gomorrah
were slain, their men were driven into the naphtha-pits of
which the plain was full, or else fled to the mountains. Their
cities fell into the hands of the conquerors, who carried away
both captives and spoil.</p>

<p class='c003'>But Abram heard that among the captives was his ‘brother’
Lot. Thereupon he started in pursuit of the Chaldæan army,
with his three hundred and eighteen armed followers and the
forces of his Amorite allies. The victorious army was overtaken
near Damascus, and its rear surprised in a night attack. The
captives and spoil were recovered, and brought back in triumph to
the south of Canaan. Here at the ‘King’s Dale,’ just outside the
walls of Jerusalem, the new king of Sodom went to welcome
him; and Melchizedek, the priest-king of Jerusalem, blessed
the conqueror in the name of ‘the Most High God.’</p>

<p class='c003'>The history of the campaign of Chedor-laomer reads like an
extract from the Babylonian chronicles. It is dated in the
reign of the king of Shinar or Babylon, as it would have been
had it been written by a Babylonian scribe, although the
Babylonian king was but the vassal and tributary of the
sovereign of Elam. Even the spelling of the names indicates
that they are taken from a cuneiform document. ‘Ham’ for
Ammon, and ‘Zuzim’ for Zamzummim, can be explained only
by the peculiarities of the cuneiform system of writing.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The whole story, however, has been thrown into a Canaanitish
form. The king of Northern Babylonia, whose capital was
Babylon, has become a king of Shinar, that being the name
given in the West to the northern half of Chaldæa.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a> Larsa, the
capital of Eri-Aku or Arioch, has been transformed into Ellasar,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>perhaps through the influence of the Babylonian <i>al</i>, city.’
Lastly, Tid’al, the Tudghula of the cuneiform texts, is entitled
the ‘king of nations.’</p>

<p class='c003'>The fragmentary tablets discovered by Mr. Pinches, in which
we hear of Khammu-rabi, king of Babylon, of Eri-Aku or
Arioch, and his son Bad-makh-dingirene, and of Kudur-Laghghamar,
the Chedor-laomer of Genesis, refer to Tudghula
or Tid’al as ‘the son of Gazza[ni].’ Unfortunately, the
words which follow, and which gave a description of the prince,
have been lost through a fracture of the clay tablet. But there
is another tablet from which we may supply the deficiency.
On the one hand we are told that Tudghula burned the
sanctuaries of Babylonia and allowed the waters of the Euphrates
to roll over the ruins of the great temples of Babylon; on the
other hand we read: ‘Who is this Kudur-Laghghamar who
has wrought evil? He has assembled the Umman Manda, has
devastated the land of Bel, and [has marched] at their side.’
Elsewhere Kudur-Laghghamar is called the king of Elam.<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The Umman Manda were the barbarous tribes in the mountains
which adjoined the northern part of Elam and formed
the eastern boundary of Babylonia. The term means the
‘Nomad,’ or ‘Barbarous Peoples,’ and is thus the Babylonian
equivalent of the Hebrew Goyyim, ‘Nations.’<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> What the
‘Gentiles,’ or Goyyim, were to the Hebrews, or the ‘Barbarians’
to the Greeks, the Umman Manda were to the
civilised population of Chaldæa. The fact that the king of
Elam summons them to his help when he invades Babylonia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>implies that they acknowledged his suzerainty. It would
seem, therefore, that the ‘Nations’ over which Tid’al is said
to have ruled were the Kurdish tribes to the east of the
Babylonian frontier.</p>

<p class='c003'>Khammu-rabi eventually succeeded in overthrowing the king
of Elam, in crushing his rival Eri-Aku and his Elamite allies, and
in making himself master of an independent Babylonia, which
was henceforth a united kingdom, with its centre and sovereign
city at Babylon. Recent excavations have brought
letters of his to light which were written to his faithful vassal
Sin-idinnam, Sin-idinnam had been the king of Larsa whom
Eri-Aku and his Elamite troops had driven from the city of
his fathers, and he had found refuge and protection in the
court of Khammu-rabi at Babylon. When the great war finally
broke out, which ended in leaving Khammu-rabi sole monarch
of Babylonia, Sin-idinnam rendered him active service, and
after the conclusion of the struggle he was reinstated in his
ancestral princedom. Khammu-rabi loaded him with other
honours as well; and one of the letters which have been
recovered refers to certain statues which were presented to
him as a reward for his ‘valour on the day of Kudur-Laghghamar’s
defeat.’ This was an Oriental anticipation of
the statues which the Greek cities of a later age bestowed
upon those they would honour.<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>It has been suggested that the reverse sustained by Kudur-Laghghamar
in Palestine at the hands of the ‘Amorites,’ under
the leadership of ‘Abram the Hebrew,’ may have given the
king of Babylon his opportunity for successfully revolting from
his liege lord. If so, the Hebrew patriarch would have influenced
the destinies of the country he had forsaken. What is
more certain is that his victory gave him a commanding position
in the country of his adoption. Syrian legend in after
days made him a king in Damascus;<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a> and when he buys the
rock-tomb of Machpelah, the owners of the land tell him that
he is no ‘stranger and sojourner’ among them, but ‘a mighty
prince,’ ‘a prince of Elohim.’ From henceforth the ‘Hebrew’
occupies a recognised place in ‘the land of the Amorites.’</p>

<p class='c003'>The figure of Melchizedek, king of Salem, loomed large
upon the imagination of later ages out of the mists that
enveloped the history of Canaanitish Jerusalem. But the
romance is now making way for sober history. The letters
on clay tablets in the Babylonian language and writing, found
at Tel el-Amarna in Upper Egypt, have come to our help.
Several of them were sent to the Pharaoh from Ebed-Tob, king
of Jerusalem, and they show that Jerusalem was already the
dominant state of Southern Palestine. Its strong position
made it a fortress of importance, and it was the capital of a
territory which stretched away towards the desert of the South.
Its name was already Jerusalem or Uru-Salim, ‘the city of
Salim,’ the God of Peace, and the hieroglyphic texts of Egypt
accordingly speak of it simply as Shalama or Salem, omitting
the needless Uru, ‘city.’<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Ebed-Tob reiterates that he was not, like the other governors
of Canaan, under Egyptian rule. They had been appointed to
their offices by the Pharaoh, or had inherited them by descent
from the older royal lines of the country whom the Egyptian
Government had allowed to remain. He, on the contrary, was
the friend and ally of the Egyptian king. His kingly dignity
had not been derived from either father or mother, but from
the ‘Mighty King,’ from the god, that is to say, whose temple
stood on ‘the mountain of Jerusalem.’ He was, therefore, a
priest-king, without father or mother, so far as his royal office
was concerned.<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>That the king of Salem, the priest of the God of Peace,
should have come forth from his city and its temple to
welcome the conqueror when he returned in peace, was both
natural and fitting. It was equally natural and fitting that
he should bless the Hebrew in the name of the ‘Most
High God’—the patron deity of Jerusalem, whom Ebed-Tob
identifies with the Babylonian Ninip—and that Abram
should in return have given him tithes of the spoil.
From time immemorial, the <i>esrâ</i> or tithe had been exacted
in Babylonia for the temples and their priests, and had
been paid alike by prince and peasant. It passed to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>West along with the other elements and institutions of
Babylonian culture.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The destruction of the cities of the Vale of Siddim, which
is represented as occurring not long after the retreat of the
king of Elam, made a profound impression on the Western
world. References are made to the catastrophe up to the
latest days of Hebrew literature; and the mist caused by the
evaporation of the salt on the surface of the Dead Sea was
popularly supposed to be the smoke which hung eternally over
the ruins of the doomed cities of the plain. The storm which
burst from the heavens set fire to the naphtha springs that
oozed through the soil, and houses and men alike were
enveloped in a sheet of fire. Similar catastrophes have
happened in our own time at Baku on the Caspian, where the
petroleum, accidentally ignited, has blazed for days in columns
of fire.</p>

<p class='c003'>Ingenious Germans have connected with the destruction of
Sodom and its sister cities a passage in the Latin writer
Justin (<abbr title='eighteen'>xviii.</abbr> 3. 2, 3), in which it is said that the Phœnicians
were driven to the Canaanitish coast by an earthquake which
took place in their original home near ‘the Assyrian lake.’
Instead of ‘Assyrian,’ some manuscripts read ‘Syrian,’ and the
lake has accordingly been imagined to be the Dead Sea, and
the earthquake to be the rain of fire which destroyed the
cities of the plain.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a> But there is no other instance in which
the Dead Sea is called ‘the Syrian lake,’ supposing this to be
the true reading, nor is there any trace of an earthquake in the
catastrophe described in Genesis. Moreover, the unanimous
voice of classical antiquity declared that the Phœnicians had
come from the Persian Gulf, not from the valley of the Jordan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and their seafaring propensities were explained by the fact
that they once lived in the islands of the Erythræan Sea.
Whatever the ‘Assyrian lake’ may have been, it was not the
‘Salt Sea’ of the Old Testament.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Israelites traced back to Abram the rite of circumcision
which they practised. The rite, however, was not confined to
Israel. So far as Western Asia is concerned, it seems to have
been of African origin. It is to be found among most of the
races and tribes of Africa, and in Egypt the institution was
of immemorial antiquity. According to Herodotos (<abbr title='two'>ii.</abbr> 36),
the Egyptians, the Ethiopians, and the Kolkhians alone
observed it ‘from the beginning,’ the Phœnicians and Syrians
of Palestine having learned it from the Egyptians, and the
Cappadocians from the people of Kolkhis. But the knowledge
of the world possessed by Herodotos was limited,
and his anthropology is not profound. The practice is met
with in various parts of the world; it owes its origin to considerations
of chastity, its maintenance to sanitary reasons. It
is true that Africa was peculiarly its home, and that it seems
to have been common to the aboriginal tribes of that continent,
but it is also true that it was known to aboriginal tribes in
other parts of the globe among whom—so far as our evidence
can tell us—the practice originated independently.<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Whether it was originally a Semitic as well as an African
rite, we do not at present know. We have as yet no certain
evidence that it was practised among the Babylonians.
Indeed, the fact that Abraham was not circumcised until
after his arrival in Canaan would imply that it was not.
Even in Canaan itself there were tribes, apart from the Philistine
immigrants, to whom it was unknown, as we learn from
the story of Hamor and Shechem (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-four'>xxxiv.</abbr> 14, <abbr class='spell'><i>sqq.</i></abbr>). And
though the inhabitants of Northern Arabia were circumcised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>in their thirteenth year, as we are told by Josephus, it is
doubtful whether the same custom prevailed in the southern
half of the peninsula. So far as Midian was concerned, we
have express testimony (<abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv.</abbr> 24-26, <abbr class='spell'>cf.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii.</abbr> 19) that the
rite was regarded as peculiar to the stranger from Egypt.</p>

<p class='c003'>It seems probable, therefore, that Herodotos was right in
declaring that circumcision had been introduced into Palestine
by the Egyptians. Intercourse between Canaan and the Delta
went back to the early days of Egyptian history, and it would
not be surprising if Egyptian influences had found their way
into Canaan at the same time. Canaanitish slaves were carried
into the valley of the Nile, and doubtless Egyptian slaves
were at times kidnapped into Canaan.</p>

<p class='c003'>The circumcision of Abraham and his household may,
consequently, have been in accordance with a custom which
had already grown up among the Amoritish population
around him. But whether this were the case or not, the rite
received a new meaning and assumed a new form. It became
the sign and seal of a religious covenant. Those who had
been circumcised were thereby devoted to the God of Abraham
and his descendants. Henceforth there was not only a
division between the circumcised and the uncircumcised, there
was also a division between those who had received the circumcision
of Abraham and those who had not. It is noticeable
that the narrative expressly includes among those who were
thus outwardly dedicated to the God of Israel not only the
ancestor of the Ishmaelite tribes of Northern Arabia, but also
the foreign slaves who belonged to the household of the
patriarch. They had left the home of their fathers, and his
God accordingly had become theirs. The fact is paralleled
by the law relating to another seal of the covenant between
Israel and its God; the Sabbath had to be kept not only by
the Israelite, but also by the ‘stranger’ within his gates.</p>

<p class='c003'>A change of name accompanied the rite which the patriarch
performed. The Babylonian Abram became the Palestinian
Abraham. To the native of the old Oriental world the name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>was not merely the representation of a thing; it was, in a
measure, the thing itself. Even Greek philosophy failed at
first to distinguish between an object and its expression in
speech. A thing was known only through its name, and in
the name were to be found its qualities and its essence. A
name which brought with it unlucky associations was itself the
bringer of ill-luck, but the ill-luck would turn to good if once
the name were changed. The belief has lingered on into our
own times, and the change of the Cape of Storms into the
Cape of Good Hope is an illustration of its influence. The
name meant personality as well as a thing. The man himself
was changed when his name was changed. Hence it was that
the Canaanites or Karians, who settled in Egypt, and there
became Egyptian citizens, at once assumed Egyptian names.
They had left Canaan and Karia behind them, with the gods
and the habits of their ancestors, and had adopted the religion
and manners of another country. They had, as it were, stripped
themselves of their old personality, and had clothed themselves
with a new one. It was thus a new personality that was
assumed by the Babylonian Abram when he became the
Abraham of Western Asia. It cut him off, as it were, from
the land of his birth, and gave him a new birth in the country
of his adoption. The merchant-prince of Babylonia, who had
overthrown the rearguard of the host of Chedor-laomer, and
whose maid had borne to him the ancestor of the Ishmaelites,
thus passed into the forefather and founder of the Israelitish
race.</p>

<p class='c003'>The etymology and meaning of the new name are unknown.
It would seem that they had been forgotten even at the time
when the book of Genesis was written. At all events, the
explanation of the name given there (<abbr title='seventeen'>xvii.</abbr> 5) is one of those
plays upon words of which the Biblical writers, like Orientals
generally, are so fond. ‘Ab-(ra)ham,’ it is said, is Ab-ham(ôn),
‘the father of a multitude,’ in total disregard of the second
syllable of the name. It may be, however, that there was
still a tradition that in <span lang="hbo"><i>raham</i></span> we have a word which had a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>similar signification to that of <span lang="hbo"><i>hamôn</i></span>, ‘a multitude,’ though
the attempts that have been made to discover any word of the
kind in the Semitic languages have hitherto been unsuccessful.
We must be content with the fact that Ab-ram, ‘the exalted
father,’ was transformed into the Israelitish Ab-raham.<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The change of name was followed by the birth of Isaac and
the expulsion of Ishmael from his father’s house. Closely
allied in blood as the Ishmaelites of north-western Arabia
were to the house of Israel, it was only in part that they shared
in the covenant made with their common father. Circumcision
indeed they also possessed, but to Israel alone was granted
the Law. To Israel alone did God reveal Himself under His
name of Yahveh.</p>

<p class='c003'>The inscriptions of a later age, which have been found in
the Ishmaelite territory, show that the language then spoken
by the Ishmaelitish tribes was Aramaic rather than what we
call Arabic.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a> From the borders of Babylonia to the Sinaitic
Peninsula, and as far north as the mountain-ranges of the
Taurus, Aramaic dialects were used. How far the difference
in language meant that the populations who spoke these
Aramaic dialects differed also in blood from the other members
of the Semitic family, we do not know, but it is probable that
the difference in blood was not great. The Semitic family
seems to have been as homogeneous in race as it was in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>speech, and the differences in speech were comparatively
slight. In fact, the Semitic languages do not differ more from
one another than the languages of modern Europe which
claim descent from Latin, and it is probable that the speaker
of an Aramaic dialect would not have had very great difficulty
in making himself intelligible to the speakers of what we term
Hebrew.</p>

<p class='c003'>Hebrew was, as Isaiah tells us (<abbr title='nineteen'>xix.</abbr> 18), ‘the language of
Canaan.’ The fact became clear to European scholars as soon
as the Phœnician inscriptions were deciphered. Between the
Hebrew of the Old Testament and the Phœnician of the
older inhabitants of Canaan the differences are less than those
between one English dialect and another. Chief among them
is the absence in Phœnician of the Hebrew article and <span lang="la"><i>waw
conversivum</i></span>. But the idiom to which grammarians have given
the latter name seems to have been an independent creation
of Hebrew itself, and even in Hebrew it disappeared in the
later stage of the language. The article is found in the so-called
Lihyanian inscriptions of Northern Arabia,<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a> and we may
regard it as one of the indications that the Israelites had been
Bedâwin before they entered Palestine and made their way
from the desert into the Promised Land.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Tel el-Amarna tablets have carried the history of
Canaanitish or Hebrew beyond the age of the Exodus. In
some of the letters written from Palestine the writers have
added the Canaanitish equivalents of certain Assyrian words
and phrases. They show that from the pre-Mosaic epoch
down to the period of the Exile the language changed but
little; the words and phrases that have thus been preserved
being substantially the same as those which we find in the
pages of the Old Testament.<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c013'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>The northern boundary between Canaanitish and Aramaic
dialects was among the mountains of Gilead. This is made
clear by the narrative of the covenant between Laban and
Jacob. At Mizpah, the ‘Watch-tower,’ which guarded the
approaches to the south, a cairn was raised, called Yegar-sahadutha
in the language of Laban, Galeed in that of Jacob
(<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-one'>xxxi.</abbr> 47, 48). The two names alike signified the ‘heap
of witnesses,’ but while the first was Aramaic, the second was
Canaanitish. The fact that the names survived into later
history shows that the line of demarcation between the two
Semitic languages which they represent continued to remain
in the same place.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c013'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Jacob, despite his long residence in Aram and his relationship
to an Aramæan family, is nevertheless Canaanite in his
language. It is a sign and proof how completely the ancestors
of the Israelites had identified themselves with the country
which their descendants were afterwards to possess. The
Canaanitish history of Israel begins long before the days of
Moses or Joshua; it already dates from the day when the
Babylonian Abram became the Abraham of Canaan, and when
the field of Machpelah was sold to him by the children of
Heth.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is true that Jacob—or it may be, Terah—is once called
in the Old Testament (<abbr title='Deuteronomy'>Deut.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-six'>xxvi.</abbr> 5) ‘a wandering Aramæan.’
But he was so only in a secondary sense. It was not as an
Aramæan, but as a wanderer out of Aramaic lands, that the
title is given him. Israel was closely connected with Aram
and Harran, but it was a relationship only.</p>

<p class='c003'>Discoveries recently made in Northern Syria by the German
explorer, Dr. von Luschan, have thrown some light on the
matter. At Sinjerli, twenty-five miles north-east of the Gulf
of Antioch, and nearly midway between Yarpuz and Aintab,
he has excavated the ruins of the capital of the ancient
kingdom of Samâla, and found monuments which make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>mention of the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser.<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c013'><sup>[48]</sup></a> Most of them,
in fact, were erected by a prince who acknowledged the
supremacy of the Assyrian monarch, and whose father’s name
is met with in the annals of the latter sovereign. The inscriptions
on them are in an Aramaic dialect; but the dialect is so
largely mixed with Hebrew words and idioms as to have made
scholars doubt at first whether it was not an Aramaised form
of Hebrew rather than an Hebraised form of Aramaic. In
any case, it is plain that the dialect was in close contact with
a population which spoke ‘the language of Canaan.’ Far
away to the north, therefore, in the heart of an Aramaic
country, there must have been speakers of Hebrew or Canaanite.
Nor is this all. Two or three miles from the ruins of Samâla
are the ruins of another ancient town, the modern name of
which is Girshin. Here, too, the German excavators have
found an inscription of the same age as those of Samâla, and
we may gather from it that Girshin stands on the site of a city
which was the capital of the land of ‘Ya’di.’ In the Tel el-Amarna
tablets, written in the century before the Exodus,
Yaudâ are mentioned as living in the same part of the world.<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c013'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
Now Yaudâ is also the Assyrian mode of spelling the name of
the Jews, and it would accordingly seem that a tribe which
bore a name similar to that of Judah existed in Northern Syria
as far back as the Patriarchal age.<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>All this is in singular harmony with the Scriptural narrative
which tells us that a part of Terah’s family lingered at Harran,
and that the wives of both Isaac and Jacob came from their
Aramæan kindred in the north. There were Hebrews in
Northern Syria as well as in Canaan, and Scripture and
archæology are alike in agreement in testifying to the fact.</p>

<p class='c003'>Even in Babylonia it may be that Abraham had been
educated in ‘the language of Canaan.’ There were colonies
of Amorite (or, as we should say, Canaanitish) merchants in
Chaldæa who had special districts and privileges assigned to
them by the Babylonian kings. Reference is not unfrequently
made to them in the contracts of the Abrahamic age. The
proper names, which sometimes make their appearance in
deeds of sale or lease, or in legal suits in which the foreign
merchants were involved, are Canaanitish and not Babylonian.
Thus we find names like Ishmael and Abdiel, Jacob-el
(Ya’qub-il), and Joseph-el (Yasup-il), and we even read of
‘the Amorite the son of Abi-ramu’ or Abram, who appears as
a witness to a deed dated in the reign of the grandfather of
Amraphel.</p>

<p class='c003'>Israel thus stood in close relation to almost all the chief
linguistic divisions of the Semitic world. Its first forefather
had been born in the land where Babylonian—or Assyrian, as
we usually term it—was spoken, and its contact with Aramaic
had been early and intimate. Its desert wanderings had led
it into a region into which the Bedâwin tribes of Central
Arabia could make their way, and the Hebrew article seems
to be a relic of its intercourse with them and the Arabic they
spoke. But with all this contact with other Semitic tongues,
Israel nevertheless remained true to that of the land of its
destiny: the language of the Old Testament is the language
which was spoken in Canaan before the days of Moses, the
language of the inscriptions of Phœnicia and Carthage, the
language of Hannibal as well as of Joshua.</p>

<p class='c003'>If Israel was connected by language with Canaan, it was
connected by blood as well as by language with Moab, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Ammon, and Edom. In fact, Edom and Israel were brothers.
While the relationship with Moab and Ammon was comparatively
distant, the relationship with Edom was peculiarly close.
The fact was never forgotten, and in the later days of Jewish
history the unbrotherly conduct of Edom caused a bitterness
of feeling towards it on the part of the Jews such as no other
Gentiles were able to excite.</p>

<p class='c003'>Moab and Ammon were the children of Lot, and had possessed
themselves of the mountain and fertile plains on the
east side of the Dead Sea and southern course of the Jordan
long before Israel had entered into its inheritance, or even
Edom had carved out a possession for itself with the sword.
They were accused of being of incestuous origin, and it was
related how the ancestors of each had been born in hiding
and in the wild solitude of a cave. Moab was the eldest,
Ben-Ammi, ‘the Ammonite,’ being the younger of the two.</p>

<p class='c003'>The name of Moab (or Muab) is engraved among the
conquests of the Egyptian Pharaoh, Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, on the base
of one of the statues which stand before the northern entrance
of the temple of Luxor. Ammi, whose ‘son’ the ancestor of
the Ammonites was called, was the supreme God of Ammon,
standing to the Ammonites in the same relation that Chemosh
stood to Moab, or Yahveh to Israel. Ammon, indeed, is but
another form of Ammi. The god was widely worshipped, as
we may learn from the proper names into which his own name
enters. Thus the Old Testament knows of Ammiel, ‘Ammi
is god’; of Ammi-shaddai, ‘Ammi is the Almighty’; and of
Ammi-nadab, ‘Ammi is noble.’ Ammi-nadab was king of
Ammon in the time of the Assyrian king Assur-bani-pal; the
early Minæan inscriptions of Southern Arabia contain names
like Ammi-zadoq and Ammi-zadiqa, ‘Ammi is righteous,’ as
well as Ammi-karib and Ammi-anshi; while among the kings
of the south Arabian dynasty which ruled over Babylonia in
the age of Abraham we find Ammi-zadoq, or Ammu-zadoq and
Ammi-dhitana; and the Kadmonite chieftain east of the Jordan,
with whom the Egyptian fugitive Sinuhit found a home in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>time of the twelfth dynasty, bore the name of Ammi-anshi.<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c013'><sup>[51]</sup></a>
Balaam the seer, moreover, was summoned by the king of
Moab from his city of Pethor, at the junction of the Euphrates
and the Sajur, in ‘the land of the children of Ammo,’—for
such is the correct translation of the Hebrew text. It may
not be an accident that one who thus belonged to the ‘Beni-Ammo,’
or ‘Ammonites’ of the north, should have been
called to the country which bordered on that of the Beni-Ammi,
or Ammonites of the south.<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c013'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>A few miles to the north of Pethor was Carchemish, now
Jerablûs, which was destined to become one of the most
important strongholds of the Hittite tribes. The Semites
explained the name as ‘the fortified wall of Chemosh’;<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c013'><sup>[53]</sup></a> and
whether this etymology were true or not, at all events it
indicates a belief that the worship of Chemosh extended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>as far northward into Aram as did the worship of Ammi.
Chemosh was the national god of Moab. Like Yahveh of
Israel and Assur in Assyria, he had neither wife nor children;
and on the Moabite Stone even the Babylonian goddess
Ashtar, whose cult had been carried to the West, is identified
with him. She ceases to have any independent existence or
sex of her own, and is absorbed into the one supreme deity
of Moabite faith. It is probable that Ammi also was similarly
conceived of as standing alone in jealous isolation, supreme
over all other gods, and having no consort with whom to
share his power.</p>

<p class='c003'>Moab and Ammon were alike intruders in the lands which
subsequently bore their names. The older inhabitants of
Moab were known as the Emim, ‘a people great and many
and tall, as the Anakim, which also were accounted giants.’
Ammon too had been ‘accounted a land of giants: giants
dwelt therein in old time, and the Ammonites call them
Zamzummim.’ The word rendered ‘giants’ in the Authorised
Version is Rephaim; and it is very possible that a trace of it
survives in the name On-Repha, ‘On of the giant,’ the Raphon
or Raphana of classical geography, which is coupled by the
Egyptian conqueror Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> with Astartu or Ashteroth-Karnaim.<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c013'><sup>[54]</sup></a>
When Chedor-laomer made his campaign in
Canaan the Rephaim were still living at Ashteroth-Karnaim,
and the ‘Zuzim’ or Zamzummim in ‘Ham.’ The name of
the latter seems to occur in the inscriptions of the kings of Ur,
who reigned some centuries before the birth of Abraham;
they mention hostile expeditions against the land of Zavzala or
the Zuzim; and a Babylonian high-priest who owned allegiance
to one of them brought blocks of limestone for his temples
and palace from the same district, which he tells us was
situated ‘in the mountains of the Amorites.’<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c013'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Whether or not the Emim and Zamzummim were Amorite
tribes, we cannot tell. The physical characteristics ascribed to
them in the Old Testament would, however, seem to indicate
that such was the case. Moreover, the Amorites had at one
time been the dominant population, not only in Palestine
itself, but also in the country east of the Jordan as well as in
the Syrian districts to the north. When the Babylonians first
became acquainted with Western Asia in the fifth or fourth
millennium before the Christian era, the inhabitants of Syria
were mainly of the Amorite race. Syria, accordingly, and
more especially that part of it which is known to us as
Palestine, was called in the old agglutinative language of
Chaldæa ‘the land of Martu’ or ‘the Amorite,’ a word which
has survived in the book of Genesis under the form of
Moreh.<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c013'><sup>[56]</sup></a> When the older language of Chaldæa made way for
Semitic Babylonian, <i>Martu</i> became <i>Amurru</i>, and Hadad, the
supreme Baal or sun-god of Canaan, became known as
‘Amurru,’ ‘the Amorite.’ By the Egyptians the Amorites
were termed Amur; and, as has been already stated,<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c013'><sup>[57]</sup></a> the
Egyptian artists have shown us that they were a fair-skinned
people, with blue eyes and reddish hair; that they were also
tall and handsome, and wore short and pointed beards. In
fact, they resembled in features the Libyans of Northern Africa,
whose modern descendants—the Kabyles of Algeria—offer such
a striking likeness to the golden-haired Kelt. The Amorite
type may still be seen in its purity among the Arabs of the El-Arîsh
desert, who inhabit the district between the frontiers of
Palestine and Egypt: many of the latter, as we see them to-day,
might well have sat for the portraits of the Amorites depicted
on the walls of the old Egyptian temples and tombs. It would
seem that the Amorite race, fair and tall and energetic, once
extended along the northern coast of Africa into Asia itself,
where they occupied the larger part of Southern Syria. There
they have left behind them cromlechs and dolmens which
remind us of those of our own islands. Indeed, if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Amorite were the eastern branch of the Libyan race, it is
probable that he could claim kindred with the so-called red
Kelt of Britain. The physiological characteristics of the
Libyan and fair-haired Kelt are similar; and many anthropologists
assume the existence of a Libyo-Keltic or ‘Eurafrican’
family, which has spread northward through Spain and the
western side of France into the British Isles.<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c013'><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The Emim and Zamzummim, accordingly, whom the descendants
of Lot partly expelled, partly absorbed, may have
been of Amorite origin, and connected in race with a portion of
the population of our own country. At all events, when the
Israelites entered Canaan, the Amorites were already settled
on the eastern side of the Jordan. At that time the land was
divided between the Amalekites or Bedâwin of the desert to
the south, the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites ‘in the mountains,’
and the Canaanites on the coast of the Mediterranean
and in the valley of the Jordan (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='thirteen'>xiii.</abbr> 29). As might
have been expected in the case of a fair-skinned people, the
Amorites needed the bracing air of the mountains in order to
hold their own against the other populations of the country;
in the hot plains their vigour was in danger of being lost.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Egyptian rule, which the Pharaohs of the eighteenth
and nineteenth dynasties had maintained eastward of the
Jordan, passed away with the fall of the Egyptian empire,
and its place was taken by the Amorite kingdoms of Sihon
and Og. Sihon had overthrown the Moabites in battle, and
had wrested their territory from them as far south as the
Arnon (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 26). They had been driven out of their
cities into the barren mountains which overlooked the Dead
Sea. A fragment of the Amorite Song of Triumph which
recorded the conquest has been preserved to us. ‘Come unto
Heshbon,’ it said, ‘let the city of Sihon be built and fortified.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>For a fire has gone forth from Heshbon, a flame from the city
of Sihon; it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the Baalim of
the high places of Arnon. Woe to thee, Moab! thou art
undone, O people of Chemosh: [Chemosh] hath given his
sons that escaped [the battle], and his daughters, into captivity
unto Sihon king of the Amorites’ (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 27-29).</p>

<p class='c003'>The southern half of Ammon also, as far north as the Jabbok,
was in Amorite hands. Here, however, the Ammonites had
strongly fortified their ‘border’ (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 24), so that neither
Sihon himself, nor his Israelitish conquerors, succeeded in
passing it. But Rabbah, ‘the city of waters,’ the future
capital of Ammon, must have been held by the Amorites, and
the two intrusive populations of Ammon and Moab were
separated from one another by the Amorite conquest.</p>

<p class='c003'>If the older inhabitants of the country were Amorite by
race, the kingdom of Sihon will have represented an Amorite
reaction against the descendants of Lot. But we must
remember that the Babylonians had given the name of
‘Amorite’ to all the populations of Palestine and the adjoining
districts, whether they were Amorites in blood or not.
The old Babylonian usage is followed in several passages of
the Pentateuch, and points to their origin in those pre-Mosaic
days when Babylonian influence was still dominant in Western
Asia. Thus in <abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 16, God declares to Abraham that
‘the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full,’ and Jacob
reminded his sons (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='forty-eight'>xlviii.</abbr> 22) that he had wrested
Shechem ‘out of the hand of the Amorite’ with his sword
and bow. Perhaps the emphatic statement that ‘the
Canaanite was then in the land,’ which we read in <abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr>
<abbr title='twelve'>xii.</abbr> 6, is due to the previous mention of the terebinth of
Moreh’ or Martu, Martu being the primitive Babylonian
equivalent of the later ‘Amorite.’ The terebinth, indeed,
was in the country of the Amorites, but the country was
already inhabited by Canaanitish tribes.<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c013'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>We cannot, then, be certain that the aboriginal peoples of
Moab and Ammon were actually of the Amorite race. They
were, it is true, included by the Babylonians under the
common name of ‘Amorites,’ but this was because all the
rest of the population of Southern Syria was known under
the same title. The fact, however, that the Hebrew writers
have described them as tall, like the Anakim, and that popular
tradition should have spoken of them as Rephaim or giants, is
in favour of their having been really of Amorite descent. In
this case we may see in them the easternmost representatives
of the blond race, and the builders of the cromlechs with
which the hillsides of Moab are covered.</p>

<p class='c003'>Southward of Moab came other tribes which, like the
Ishmaelites, were said to have sprung directly from Abraham
himself. These were the Midianites and the merchant tribes
of Sheba and Dedan, who possessed stations on the great
desert road that led from the spice-bearing regions of Southern
Arabia to the borders of Canaan. They claimed to be the
descendants of Keturah, or ‘Incence,’ the second wife of the
Hebrew patriarch, after Sarah’s death. Another genealogy
(<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'>x.</abbr> 7) placed Sheba and Dedan in the extreme south
of the Arabian peninsula, among the children of Cush. Both
genealogies, however, are correct. Sheba was the kingdom
of the Sabæans, whose centre was in Southern Arabia, but
whose power and commerce extended far to the north. Their
trading settlements and garrisons were to be found in the
immediate neighbourhood of Midian, at Tema, the modern
Teimah, and elsewhere.<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c013'><sup>[60]</sup></a> If Professor Hommel is right in
identifying Dedan with Tidanum, one of the names by which
Palestine was known in early days to the natives of Babylonia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>it would seem that the Dedanites also had become a leading
people on the frontiers of Canaan. At all events, it is clear
that Abraham was claimed as an ancestor by the tribes of
Western Arabia from its northern to its southern extremity, by
the descendants of Keturah on the western coast and caravan-road,
as well as by the Ishmaelites further to the east. They
represented the trading and more cultured population of the
peninsula as opposed to the wild Amalekites or Bedâwin
hordes, who had their home among the mountains of Seir and
the desert south of Palestine. The connection between Midian
and Israel, which found expression in a common ancestry, was
reasserted in later days when the great legislator of Israel fled
to Midian and married the daughter of its high-priest.</p>

<p class='c003'>How nearly that connection had been lost through the
death of the forefather of the Israelitish people was recorded
in the story of the sacrifice of Isaac. A voice came to
Abraham, which he believed to be divine, bidding him offer
‘for a burnt-offering’ the son of his old age, the heir of the
covenant which had been made with him. It was a form of
sacrifice only too well known in Canaan. In time of pestilence
or trouble the parent was called upon to sacrifice to Baal that
which was dearest and nearest to him, his firstborn or his
only son. The gods themselves had set the example. Once
when a plague had fallen upon the land, El had clothed Yeud,
his only son, in royal purple, and on one of the high-places of
Palestine had offered him up to the offended deities.<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c013'><sup>[61]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>doctrine of vicarious sacrifice was deeply enrooted in the
minds of the Canaanitish people. But it needed to be a
sacrifice which cost the offerer almost as much as his own life.
The fruit of his own body could alone wipe away the sin of
his soul. And the sacrifice had to be by fire. Only through
that purifying element could the stains of sin and impurity
be obliterated, and the offering made acceptable to
heaven.</p>

<p class='c003'>The practice, horrible as it seems to us, was nevertheless
founded on a truth. The victim, if he were to be accepted,
must be the most precious that the offerer could present. The
gods did not require that which cost him nothing. It needed
to be the most costly that could be given; it needed to be
also, in the words of the prophet, the fruit of the sinner’s own
body. Nothing else would suffice: the gods demanded the
firstborn son, still more the only son. In no other way could
Baal be satisfied that the sinner had repented of his guilt or
had made to him an offering which was of equal value to his
own life.</p>

<p class='c003'>The firstborn of all animals, of beasts as well as of men,
was owed to the gods. The belief was not confined to the
Canaanites. We find traces of it in Babylonian literature, and
all the denunciations of the prophets before the Exile failed to
eradicate it from the mind of the Jew. Up to the closing days
of the Jewish monarchy, the valley of the sons of Hinnom was
defiled with the smoke of the sacrifices wherein, as it is
euphemistically said, the kings and people of Jerusalem made
their children to pass through the fire. The belief, indeed,
was consecrated by the Mosaic law itself. Human sacrifice,
it is true, was forbidden, but the firstborn, nevertheless, had
to be redeemed (<abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-four'>xxxiv.</abbr> 20). Like the firstfruits and the
firstborn of beasts, Yahveh had declared that the firstborn of
the sons of Israel also belonged to Him (<abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-two'>xxii.</abbr> 29). He
could claim them, and it was of His own freewill that He
waived the claim. And along with this assertion of His claim
to the firstborn went the doctrine of vicarious punishment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>It was not the firstborn only in whose case a substitution was
allowed: once a year the sins of the whole people were laid
upon the head of the scapegoat, which was then driven like
an evil spirit into the wilderness. The idea of vicarious
punishment, which lies at the foundation of historical
Christianity, had already found expression in the Mosaic
law.</p>

<p class='c003'>The sacrifice of the firstborn was thus part of a larger
conception behind which there lay a profound truth. The
sins of the father were visited upon the child in more senses
than one; the child, in fact, could become an expiation for
them, and divert to himself the anger of the gods. Experience
had shown how often the son must suffer for the deeds of the
parent, and the inference was drawn that if that suffering were
voluntarily offered to heaven by the parent, he would receive
all the benefits that flowed from it. Moreover, the gods had
a right to the firstborn, if they chose to exercise it; and in
offering the firstborn, accordingly, man was only giving back
to them what was strictly their own.</p>

<p class='c003'>The heathenism of the Mosaic age went no further. Israel
was the first to learn that the law of the substitution of the
firstborn for the sins of the father was subordinate to a higher
and more general law—that of vicarious punishment. As the
firstborn of men could be substituted for the parent, so, too,
could a lower animal, or the price of a lower animal, be substituted
for the firstborn of men. It was not the sacrifice
which the God of Israel demanded, but the spirit of sacrifice;
not the blood of bulls and goats, or even men, but obedience
and readiness to give up all that was dearest and best at the
command of God.</p>

<p class='c003'>The story of the sacrifice of Isaac was a practical illustration
of the lesson. Abraham was called upon to slay with his
own hand his only child, the son through whom he had
believed that he would become the ancestor of a mighty
nation. He was summoned to lead him to one of those high-places
of Canaan where the deity seemed nearer to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>worshipper than in the plain below, and there, like the
Phœnician god El, to offer him up to his God. We are told
how he set forth from Beer-sheba, on the borders of the desert,
and on the third day reached the sacred mountain on whose
summit the Canaanitish rite was to be celebrated. It was in
‘the land of Moriah,’ according to the reading of the Hebrew
text, a name which the chronicler (2 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 1) transfers to
the temple-mount at Jerusalem. But the Septuagint changes
the name in the books of Chronicles into that of ‘the mountain
of Amoria’ or the Amorites; while in Genesis the Greek
translators must have read Moreh, since the Hebrew word is
rendered by ‘Highlands.’ Moreh is the Babylonian Martu,
the land of the Amorites, so that we need not be surprised at
finding the Syriac version boldly substituting ‘Amorites’ for
the Masoretic ‘Moriah.’</p>

<p class='c003'>In any case, the belief that the scene of Abraham’s sacrifice
was the spot whereon the Jewish temple afterwards stood went
back to an early date. When the book of Genesis assumed
its present form it had already become fixed in the Jewish
mind. This is clear from the proverb quoted to explain the
name of Yahveh-yireh. ‘To this day,’ we are told, it was
said: ‘In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.’ For the
Jew there was but one ‘mount of the Lord,’ that mountain
whereon Yahveh revealed Himself above the cherubim of the
ark. It was ‘the hill of God,’ wherein He desired to dwell
(<abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr> <abbr title='sixty-eight'>lxviii.</abbr> 15), the seat of the sanctuary of Yahveh the God
of Israel. When the Samaritans set up on Gerizim their rival
temple to that of Jerusalem, it was necessary that the scene
of the sacrifice of the Hebrew patriarch should be transferred
to the new site. It was a proof how firm was the conviction
that the temple-mount had been consecrated to the sacrifice
of the firstborn by the great ancestor of the Israelitish family.
The spot whereon the victims of the Jewish ritual were offered
up was the very spot to which Abraham had been led by God
that he might offer there the terrible sacrifice of his only son.
Its name had been given to it by Abraham, and this name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>found its explanation in a saying that was current at Jerusalem
about the temple-mount.</p>

<p class='c003'>The actual meaning of the name is not certain, nor indeed
is the original signification of the proverb itself. Already in
the time of the Septuagint translation the meaning of the
latter was doubtful, and the Greek translators have made the
divine name the subject of the verb, reading, ‘In the mountain
the Lord was seen.’ But the fact that the Chronicler calls the
temple-mount Moriah shows that such a rendering was not
accepted in Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c003'>It may be that the name ‘mount of the Lord’ goes back,
at all events in substance, to patriarchal times. Among the
places in Southern Palestine conquered by the Egyptian
Pharaoh, Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>, of the eighteenth dynasty, and recorded
on the temple walls of Karnak, is Har-el, ‘the mountain
of God.’<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c013'><sup>[62]</sup></a> The names found in immediate connection with
Har-el indicate that its site is to be sought in the neighbourhood
of Jerusalem; and as the name of Jerusalem itself does
not occur in the Pharaoh’s list of his conquests, it is probable
that we are to see in it the future capital of Judah. As we
now know from the Tel el-Amarna tablets, Jerusalem was an
important city of Canaan long before the Mosaic age; it was,
moreover, the centre of a district which had been conquered
by the Egyptians, and its ruler was a vassal of the Egyptian
monarch. It is therefore difficult to account for the omission
of any reference to it in the catalogue of the conquests of the
Pharaoh except upon the supposition that it is really mentioned
among them, though under another name.</p>

<p class='c003'>The distance that separates Jerusalem from Beer-sheba
would correspond with the three days’ journey of Abraham
to the destined place of sacrifice. It was on the third day
that Abraham lifted up his eyes ‘and saw the place afar off.’
The main, in fact, the only, argument of any weight that has
been urged against the identification is the fact that the place
of sacrifice seems to have been a desert spot. No spectators
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>are mentioned as present, and close to it was a thicket in
which a ram was caught by the horns. How can such solitude,
it is asked, be reconciled with the existence of a city in
the same spot? How can the deserted high-place whereon
the patriarch raised the altar of sacrifice for his son be
identical with the fortress-city of which Melchizedek was
king?</p>

<p class='c003'>At first sight the difficulty seems overwhelming. But we
must remember that nothing is said in the narrative about
the place being desert and remote from men, nor even that
it was not within the walls of a city. And we must further
remember that the temple of Solomon itself was built on what
had been the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite. Before
the age of Solomon, therefore, the place must have been open
and free from buildings; it must, too, have been a level platform
of rock on the summit of the hill where the winds could
freely play and scatter the chaff when the grain was threshed.
Such open spaces are not infrequent in Oriental cities, and the
visitor sometimes finds himself suddenly emerging out of
close and crowded lanes into a growth of rank brushwood and
weeds.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is true that in the books of Samuel, where we are told
how the threshing-floor of the Jebusite came to be chosen as
the site of the temple, no allusion is made to Abraham’s
sacrifice. Another reason is assigned for the choice of the
spot. But Oriental modes of writing history are not the same
as ours, and the so-called argument from silence is worthless
when applied to them. Archæological discovery has shown,
time after time, that facts and references are passed over in
silence by the writers of ancient Oriental history, not because
the writers did not know them, but because their conception
of history was different from ours.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mount Moriah, then, may well have been the scene of that
temptation of Abraham when, in accordance with the fierce
ritual of Syria, he believed himself called upon to offer up in
sacrifice his only son. At all events, the belief that it was so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>can be traced back to an early date among the Jews. The
very fact that the Samaritans transported the place of sacrifice
to Mount Gerizim proves that it had already been associated
with the site of the temple, and the transference of the site
was necessary in support of the claim that the true centre of
Hebrew worship was at Samaria and not in Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c003'>Light has been cast on the substitution of a ram for the
human victim by an acute observation of <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Clermont-Ganneau.<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c013'><sup>[63]</sup></a>
We know that human sacrifice occupied a prominent
place in the ritual of Phœnicia and Carthage; and yet
in the so-called sacrificial tariffs which have been discovered at
Carthage and Marseilles, and in which the price is stated of
each of the offerings demanded by the gods, there is absolute
silence in regard to it. The place of the human victim is
taken by the <i>ayîl</i>, the ‘ram’ of the book of Genesis.<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c013'><sup>[64]</sup></a> The
tariffs of Carthage and Marseilles belong to that later period
of Phœnician religion, when contact with the Greeks had
introduced Western ideas of the value of human life, and a
truer conception of what the gods required. The merchants
of Carthage had learned that Baal would be satisfied with a
victim less costly than man, and would accept instead of him
the blood of rams.</p>

<p class='c003'>The lesson which the Carthaginians learned from contact
with the Greeks had been taught the ancestors of the
Hebrews by the Lord. The Law and the Prophets alike
protested against the old belief, hard as it was to eradicate
it from the Semitic mind. The sacrifice of Jephthah’s
daughter stands alone, even in the troublous period of the
Judges; the sacrifice of his eldest son by the king of Moab
(2 Kings <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 27), though it stayed the Israelitish attack, was the
act of one who did not acknowledge Yahveh of Israel as his
God; and the Jewish children who were burnt in the fire to
Moloch were offered by renegades from the national faith.
Israelitish law and history bear upon them the traces of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>old Semitic custom, but they are traces only. The story of
Abraham’s sacrifice is an antitype of the future history of the
religion of Israel. The firstborn, indeed, belonged to Yahveh,
if He chose to claim them; but, unlike the gods of the
heathen, He did not claim them when they were the firstborn
of man.</p>

<p class='c003'>Once again we have a picture of Abraham; but this time it
is not as the shêkh who conforms to the beliefs and practices
of Canaan, but as a foreign prince who acquires land in the
country of his adoption. Sarah is dead, and Abraham accordingly
buys a field at Machpelah in the close neighbourhood of
Hebron. The field included a portion of the limestone cliff
which overlooked the city, and was pierced then, as now, by
numerous cavities, partly natural, partly excavated by the hand
of man. They were the burying-places of the inhabitants of
the town, the chambered tombs in which the dead were laid
to rest. That Abraham should choose Hebron as the future
home and resting-place of his family was perhaps natural. It
was here that he had lived when he first came, as an immigrant,
into ‘the land of the Amorites’; it was here that he had
been confederate with its Amorite chieftains, and had led his
forces against the invading host of the king of Elam. Moreover,
Hebron was one of the old centres of Canaan. It had
been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='thirteen'>xiii.</abbr> 22),
perhaps in the age when the Hyksos kings first conquered
Egypt and rebuilt Zoan, making it the capital of their new
kingdom. The sanctuary of Hebron rivalled that of Jerusalem
in sanctity and fame, at all events in the years immediately
succeeding the Israelitish conquest, and it was at Hebron that
David first established his power and his son Absalom matured
his rebellion.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the age of Abraham the city had not yet received its later
name of Hebron, the ‘Confederacy.’ It was still known as
Kirjath-Arba, and the district in which it stood was that of
Mamre. Amorites and Hittites dwelt there side by side. Arba,
we are told, was ‘a great man among the Amorite Anakim’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>(<abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 15), but it was from ‘the sons of Heth’ that the
field of Machpelah was bought.</p>

<p class='c003'>Critics have raised the question who these Hittites of
Southern Palestine may have been. It has been asserted that
they are the invention of a later Hebrew writer, and that the
Hittites of Northern Syria were never settled in the south of
Canaan. On the other hand, the veracity of the Hebrew record
has been admitted, but the identity of ‘the sons of Heth’
with the great Hittite tribes of the north has been denied.</p>

<p class='c003'>The critics, however, have no grounds for their scepticism.
The book of Genesis does not stand alone in testifying to
the existence of Hittites in Southern Palestine. The prophet
Ezekiel does the same. He too tells us that the origin of
Jerusalem was partly Amorite, partly Hittite. Indeed,
throughout the Pentateuch it is assumed that Hittites and
Amorites were mingled together in the mountainous parts of
the country. ‘The Hittites and the Jebusites and the
Amorites,’ it is said in the book of Numbers (<abbr title='thirteen'>xiii.</abbr> 29), ‘dwell
in the mountains,’ and the same combination of names in the
same order is found in the geographical table of Genesis (<abbr title='ten'>x.</abbr>
15, 16). Between these Hittites and the Hittites of the north
no distinction is made in the Old Testament. ‘The land of
the Hittites,’ mentioned in <abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 26, into which the Canaanite
betrayer of Beth-el made his way, was in the north, like the
Hittite kingdoms whose princes are referred to in 2 Kings
<abbr title='seven'>vii.</abbr> 6.</p>

<p class='c003'>Thanks to archæological discovery, we now know a good
deal about these Hittites of Northern Syria. Their name is
found on the monuments of Egypt, of Assyria, and of Armenia,
and they are mentioned in Babylonian tablets which go back
to the age of Abraham. Cappadocia was their earliest home;
from hence they descended on the possessions of the Aramæans
and established their power as far south as the Lake of
Homs. The cuneiform inscriptions of Armenia in the ninth
century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> describe them as on the Upper Euphrates in the
neighbourhood of Malatiyeh, and the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span><abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> (<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1100) tells us that Carchemish was one of
their capitals. In the Tel el-Amarna tablets we hear of their
growing power on the northern frontier of the Egyptian empire,
of their intrigues with the Amorites and the people of Canaan,
and of their steady advance to the south. Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, the
Pharaoh of the Oppression, after twenty years of warfare, was
glad to conclude peace on equal terms with ‘the great king
of the Hittites.’ The Hittite capital was already so near the
northern border of Palestine as Kadesh on the Orontes ‘in
the land of the Amorites.’ Here the Hittite monarch gathered
together his vassals and allies from Syria and Asia Minor;
even the distant Lycians and Dardanians came at his call.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Egyptian artists have left us portraits of the Hittite
race. Their features and dress were alike peculiar, and both
reappear without change on certain monuments which have
been found in Asia Minor and Syria, thus fixing the character
of the latter beyond dispute. The monuments are covered
with a still undeciphered system of hieroglyphic writing, and
among the hieroglyphs are numerous human heads with the
strange profile of the Hittite face. The nose and upper jaw
protrude, the forehead is high and receding, the cheeks smooth,
while we learn from the paintings of Egypt that the skin was
yellow and the hair and the eyes were black. The hair was
gathered together in a kind of ‘pig-tail,’ and the feet were
shod with the shoes of mountaineers, the toes of which rose
upwards into a point.<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c013'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Why should not a body of Hittites have settled in Southern
Palestine, and there have been, as it were, interlocked with
the older Amorite inhabitants, as they were according to the
testimony of the Egyptian inscriptions at Kadesh on the Lake
of Homs? Indeed, there is indirect evidence that such was
really the case.</p>

<p class='c003'>Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>, who conquered Syria for the eighteenth
Egyptian dynasty, tells us that he received tribute from the
king of ‘the greater Hittite land.’ There was then a lesser
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Hittite land; and as the ‘greater Hittite land’ was in the
north, it is reasonable to look for the lesser land in the south.
Half a century later, at a time when the Tel el-Amarna correspondence
was being carried on, the Hittites were actively
interfering in the internal politics of Canaan; and in one of
the bas-reliefs of Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> at Karnak the vanquished population
of Ashkelon—in the near neighbourhood of Hebron—is
represented with the peculiar Hittite type of face.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c013'><sup>[66]</sup></a> At a
still earlier date, when the Assyrians first became acquainted
with Western Asia, the dominant people there were the
Hittites. In the Assyrian inscriptions, accordingly, the whole
of Syria, including Palestine, came to be known as ‘the land
of the Hittites.’ Shalmaneser <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> even speaks of Ahab of
Israel and Baasha of Ammon as ‘Hittite’ kings.<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c013'><sup>[67]</sup></a> ‘The
land of the Hittites’ in the Assyrian texts thus corresponds
with the ‘land of the Amorites’ in the texts of Babylonia.
Just as Canaan was ‘the land of the Amorites’ to the Babylonian
of the age of Abraham, so too it was ‘the land of the
Hittites’ to the Assyrian of the age of Moses. Before Assyria
had become acquainted with the shores of the Mediterranean,
the Hittites had taken the place of the Amorites and become
the leading power in the West.</p>

<p class='c003'>There is, therefore, nothing antecedently improbable in the
existence in Southern Palestine of Hittites of the genuine
northern stock. But the name may also be due to the
Assyrian use of it at the time when the narrative in the book
of Genesis was written. The use of the term ‘Amorite’ in
several passages of the Pentateuch is certainly of Babylonian
origin, and takes us back to the age when all the natives of
Palestine were alike included in it; it may be that the
‘Hittites’ of Hebron and Jerusalem owe their title to a
similar adoption of a foreign term. If so, the Amorites and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Hittites were equally one people; but whereas the name of
‘Amorite’ comes from Babylonia and indicates an earlier date
for the sources of the narrative in which it occurs, the name
of ‘Hittite’ points to Assyria and the Assyrian epoch of
Asiatic history.</p>

<p class='c003'>Against this is the Babylonian colouring of the story of
Abraham’s dealings with the children of Heth. During the
last few years thousands of contract-tablets have been discovered
in Babylonia which belong to the age of Abraham or
to a still earlier period. And these tablets show that in the
account of the purchase of the field of Machpelah we have a
faithful picture of such transactions as they were conducted at
the time in the cities of Babylonia. It reads, in fact, like one
of the cuneiform documents which have been unearthed from
Babylonian soil. It is conformed to the law and procedure
of Babylonia as they were in the patriarchal age. At a later
date the law and procedure were altered, and a narrative in
which they are embodied must therefore go back to a pre-Mosaic
antiquity. It must belong to the Babylonian and not
to the Assyrian epoch.</p>

<p class='c003'>That the law and custom of Babylonia should have prevailed
in Canaan is no longer surprising. The same contract-tablets
which have revealed to us the commercial and social life of
primitive Chaldæa have also shown us that colonies of
‘Amorite’ or Canaanitish merchants were settled in Babylonia,
where they enjoyed numerous rights and privileges, and
could acquire land and other property. There were special
districts called ‘Amorite’ allotted to them, one of which was
just outside the walls of the city of Sippara. They had judges
of their own, and where disputes arose between themselves
and the native Babylonians the case was tried before both the
‘Amorite’ and the native courts. These foreign settlers could
act as witnesses in trials that concerned only Babylonians, and
could even rise to high offices of state. It must be remembered,
however, that the Babylonian kings claimed to be kings
also of ‘the land of the Amorites,’ and that consequently the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>natives of Canaan were as much subjects of the rulers of
Chaldæa as the Babylonians themselves.</p>

<p class='c003'>Through the Canaanitish colonies in Babylonia a knowledge
of Babylonian law was necessarily communicated to
the commercial world of the West. Moreover, Babylonian
rule brought with it Babylonian culture and law as well.
The ‘Amorites’ when the Babylonians first met with them
were doubtless in a semi-barbarous condition, and their subsequent
culture, as we now know, was wholly Babylonian.
A very important part of this culture, at all events in
the eyes of the trading world, was the law of Babylonia,
more especially in its relation to contracts. That the purchase
of the field of Machpelah should have been conducted
with all the formalities to which Abraham had been
accustomed in his Chaldæan home, is consequently what
archæological discovery has informed us ought to have been
the case.</p>

<p class='c003'>A simple form of contract for the sale and purchase of
landed property in Babylonia is to be found in one that was
drawn up in the reign of Eri-Aku or Arioch. It is written in
Sumerian, the old legal language of Chaldæa, as Latin was the
legal language of Europe in the Middle Ages, and runs as
follows:—‘One and five-sixths <i>sar</i><a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c013'><sup>[68]</sup></a> of a terrace with a house
upon it, bounded on three sides by the house of Abil-Sin, and
on the fourth side by the street, has been purchased by Sin-uzilli
the son of Tsili-Istar from Sin-illatsu the son of Nannar-arabit:
2-½ shekels of silver he has weighed as its full price. In
days to come Sin-illatsu shall never make any claim in regard to
the house or dispute the title. The (contracting parties) have
sworn by the names of Sin, Samas, and king Eri-Aku. Witnessed
by Abu-ilisu the son of Tsili-Istar, Abil-Sin the son of
Uruki-bansum, Nur-Amurri the son of Abi-idinnam, Ibku-Urra,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>son of Nabi-ilisu, and Sin-semê his brother. The seals
of the witnesses (are attached).’<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c013'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Still more insight into the character and procedure of Babylonian
commercial law is given by the record of a case
of disputed property which came before the judges in the
reign of Khammu-rabi or Amraphel. The following is a
translation of it:—‘Concerning the garden of Sin-magir which
Naid-Amurri bought for silver, but to which Ilu-bani laid
claim on the ground that he had bred horses there. They
went before the judges, and the judges took them to the gate
of the goddess Nin-Martu (the mistress of the land of the
Amorites), and to the judges of the gate of Nin-Martu Ilu-bani
thus declared in the gate of Nin-Martu: I am indeed the
son of Sin-magir; he adopted me as his son; the sealed
documents (recording the fact) he never destroyed. Thus he
declared, and under (king) Eri-Aku they adjudged the garden
and house to Ilu-bani. Then came Sin-mubalidh and claimed
the garden of Ilu-bani; so they went before the judges, and
the judges (said): To us and the elders they have been taken,
and must stand in the gate of the gods Merodach, Sussa, Sin,
Khusa, and Nin-Martu the daughter of Merodach ... and
the elders who have already appeared in the case of Naid-Amurri
have heard Ilu-bani declare in the gate of Nin-Martu
that “I am indeed the son (of Sin-magir)”; accordingly, they
adjudged the garden and house to Ilu-bani. Sin-mubalidh
cannot come again and make a claim. Oaths have been sworn
by the names of Sin, Samas, Merodach, and king Khammu-rabi.
Witnessed by Sin-imguranni the noble, Elilka-Sin, Abil-irzitim,
Ubarrum, Zanbil-arad-Sin, Akhiya, Bel-dugul (?),
Samas-bani the son of Abid-rakhas, Zanik-pisu, Izkur-Ea
the major-domo, and Bau-ila. The seals of the witnesses
(are attached). The 4th day of the month Tammuz,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>the year when Khammu-rabi the king offered prayers to
Tasmit.’<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c013'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>It is needless to quote other documents of a similar nature,
unless it be to add that when a field or garden is sold, the
palms and other trees planted in it are carefully specified.
So they were also in the case of the field of Machpelah. Here,
too, the transaction took place before the ‘elders’ of the city,
at ‘the gate’ through which the people entered, and it was
duly witnessed by ‘the children of Heth.’<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c013'><sup>[71]</sup></a> The fact that ‘a
stranger and a sojourner’ could thus acquire landed property
and hand it down to his descendants was in strict accordance
with Babylonian law. As the Canaanite in Babylonia could
buy land and leave it to his children, so too the Babylonian
in Canaan could do the same. Even the technical words
used in recording the deed of sale are of Babylonian origin.
The shekel is the Babylonian <i>siqlu</i>, and the Babylonian was
the first who spoke of ‘weighing silver’ in the sense of ‘paying
money.’<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c013'><sup>[72]</sup></a> The statement that the shekels were ‘current
with the merchant’ takes us back to those Babylonian ‘merchants’
who played so great a part in the early Babylonian
world. It was for them that Dungi, king of Ur, long before
the birth of Abraham, had fixed the monetary standard which
remained in use down to the later days of the Chaldæan monarchy.
He had determined by law the weight and value of the
maneh, of which the sixtieth part was a shekel, and only those
manehs and shekels which conformed to it could be accepted
by the Babylonian trader. The words of Genesis are a curious
indication of the period of society to which they must belong.<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c013'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>There was evolution in Babylonian law as in the law of all other
countries; and though the early contracts remained a model
for those of a later epoch, their style and form underwent
change. The Assyrian and later Babylonian contracts resemble
them, it is true, in their main outlines; but they have become
more complicated, and the older phraseology is altered in
many respects. The ‘elders’ no longer appear as witnesses;
it is no longer needful to try cases of disputed title at the
various gates of the city; and it is questionable whether
foreigners could claim the same rights in regard to possessions
in land that they did in the days of Amraphel and
Arioch. The sale of the field of Machpelah belongs essentially
to the early Babylonian and not to the Assyrian period.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is only fragments of the life of Abraham that are brought
before us in the pages of Genesis. They are like a series of
pictures which have been saved from the shipwreck of the past.
And the pictures are not always painted in the same colours.
At one time the patriarch appears as ‘a mighty prince,’ as a
rich and cultured Chaldæan immigrant, with armed bands of
warriors under him with whom he can venture to attack even
the army of the king of Elam. He is the confederate of the
Amorite chieftains, the prince whom the Hittites of Hebron
hear with respect. But at another time the colours on the
canvas seem quite different. When the angels warn the
patriarch of the approaching overthrow of the cities of the
plain, they find him in the tent of a Bedâwi, leading the simple
life of an uncultured nomad, and preparing the food of his
guests with his own hands. Between this Bedâwi shêkh and
the companion of the king of Gerar or the Pharaoh of Egypt
the contrast is indeed great.</p>

<p class='c003'>To the Western mind, however, the contrast is greater than
it would be to the Oriental. The traveller in the East is well
acquainted with wealthy Bedâwin shêkhs who live in the
desert in barbaric simplicity, but, nevertheless, have their
houses at Cairo or Damascus, where they indulge in all the
luxury and splendour of Oriental life. Moreover, the narratives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>which have been combined in the book of Genesis do not
all come from the same source. Some of them have been
taken from written historical documents which breathe the
atmosphere of the cultured city, of the educated scribe, and
the luxurious court. Others, derived it may be from oral
tradition, are filled with the spirit of the wanderer in the
desert, and set before us the simple life and rude fare of the
dweller in tents. The history of the patriarchs is, in fact, like
Joseph’s coat of many colours. It is a series of pictures
rather than a homogeneous whole. The materials of which it
is composed differ widely in both character and origin. Some
of them can be shown to have been contemporaneous with
the events they record; some again to have been like the
tales of their old heroes recounted by the nomad Arabs in the
days before Islam as they sat at night round their camp-fires.
The details and spirit of the story have necessarily caught the
colour of the medium through which they have passed. The
life of Abraham, doubtless, presented the contrasts still presented
by that of a rich Bedâwi shêkh; at one time spent in the
wild freedom and privations of the desert; at another amid
the luxuries and culture of the town; but the contrasts have
been heightened by the difference in the sources through
which they have been handed down. Naturally, while the
scribe would record only those phases of Abraham’s history
which brought him into contact with the great world of kings
and princes, of war and trade, the nomad reciter of ancient
stories would dwell rather on such parts of it as he and his
hearers could understand. For them Abraham would become
a desert-wanderer like themselves.</p>

<p class='c003'>This difference in the sources of the narrative explains why
it is that the figure of Abraham so largely overshadows that of
his son Isaac. Isaac seems almost swallowed up in that
darkness of antiquity through which the figure of his father
looms so largely. Apart from his dispute with Abimelech
of Gerar, which reads like a repetition of the dispute between
Abimelech and Abraham, there is little told of the life of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Isaac which is not connected with his more famous father or
son. Between Abraham and Jacob, the great ancestors of
Israel, Isaac seems to intervene as merely a connecting link.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the life of Isaac was that of a Bedâwi shêkh. The
other side of his father’s life and character was lost. The
forefather of Israel had ceased to be a Chaldæan, and had
become simply a dweller in the desert, like the fugitive slaves
from Egypt in after days. Even Hebron was left, and the
life of Isaac was mainly passed on the northern edge of that
desert in which his descendants were in later times to receive
the Law. If he approached Canaan, it was only to Beer-sheba
and Gerar on the southern skirts of Canaanitish territory,
where the Bedâwin and their flocks still claimed to be masters.
But his chief residence was further south, in the very heart of
the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c003'>Isaac was thus essentially a Bedâwi, a fit type of the phase
of life through which the Israelites were destined to pass
before their conquest of the Promised Land. With the
politics and trade of the civilised world, accordingly, he never
came into contact. There was nothing in his existence for
the historian to chronicle; nothing which could bring his name
into the written history of the time. If his memory were to
be preserved at all, it could be only through the unwritten
traditions of the desert, through the tales told of him among
the desert tribes.</p>

<p class='c003'>Once indeed, it is said, he had relations with a king. The
king was one of those Canaanitish princelets with whose
names the Tel el-Amarna tablets are filled. The dominions
of Abimelech of Gerar were of small extent, and must have
been barren in the extreme. The site of Gerar lies two hours
south of Gaza,<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c013'><sup>[74]</sup></a> and the territory of its king extended eastward
as far as Beer-sheba. It was essentially a desert territory:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>during the greater part of the year the whole country is bare
and sterile; only after rain does the wilderness break forth
suddenly into green herbage.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the story of Isaac’s dispute with Abimelech the writer of
Genesis calls him ‘king of the Philistines,’ and speaks of his
subjects as ‘Philistines.’ This, however, is an accommodation
to the geography of a later day. In the age of the patriarchs
the south-eastern corner of Palestine has not as yet been
occupied by the Philistine immigrants. We have learned from
the Egyptian monuments that they were pirates from the
islands and coasts of the Greek Seas who did not seize upon
the frontier cities of Southern Canaan until the time of the
Pharaoh Meneptah, the son of Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> Up to then, for
more than three centuries, the frontier cities had been garrisoned
by Egyptian troops, and included in the Egyptian empire. It
was not till the period of the Exodus that the district passed
into Philistine hands, and the old road into Egypt by the sea-coast
became known as ‘the way of the Philistines.’</p>

<p class='c003'>In speaking of the ‘Philistines,’ therefore, the writer of the
book of Genesis is speaking proleptically. And in reading
the narrative of Isaac’s dealings with Abimelech by the side of
that of Abraham’s dealings with the same king, it is difficult
to resist the conclusion that we have before us two versions of
the same event. Doubtless, history repeats itself; disputes
about the possession of wells in a desert-land can frequently
recur, and it is possible that two kings of the same name may have
followed one another on the throne of Gerar. But what does
not seem very possible is that each of these kings should have
had a ‘chief captain of his host’ called by the strange non-Semitic
name of Phichol (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 22; <abbr title='twenty-six'>xxvi.</abbr> 26); that each
of them should have taken the wife of the patriarch, believing
her to be his sister; or that Beer-sheba should twice have
received the same name from the oaths sworn over it.</p>

<p class='c003'>When we compare the two versions together, it is not
difficult to see which of them is the more original. It is in
the second that Abimelech is called ‘king of the Philistines’;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>in the first he is correctly entitled ‘king of Gerar.’ Abraham
was justified in calling Sarah his sister; there was no ground
and no reason for Isaac doing the same in the case of his
own wife. Moreover, Beer-sheba had already received its name
from Abraham, who had planted there an <i>êshel</i> or tamarisk,
and ‘called on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God.’</p>

<p class='c003'>The wife of Isaac was brought from Harran, from the
members of Abraham’s race who had settled in Northern
Syria, and there become an Aramæan family. She was the
daughter of Bethuel, ‘the house of God,’ a proper name which
is found in the Tel el-Amarna letters, where it also belongs to
a native of Northern Syria.<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c013'><sup>[75]</sup></a> Bethuel is the older form of
Bethel, that anointed stone which, according to Semitic belief,
was the special residence of divinity. There was something
peculiarly appropriate in such a name at Harran, where the
great temple of the Moon-god, the ‘Baal of Harran,’ was
itself a Beth-el on a large scale.</p>

<p class='c003'>That Isaac should have lived all his life long in the southern
desert, and that his name should have been associated with
none of the ancient sanctuaries of Canaan, Beer-sheba alone
excepted, is perhaps curious when we bear in mind a passage
in the prophecies of Amos (<abbr title='seven'>vii.</abbr> 9), where it is with Northern
Israel and not with Judah that the name of the patriarch is
connected. Isaac, however, was as much the forefather of the
Israelites of Samaria as he was of those of Jerusalem; and the
use of his name by the prophet shows only that he was no
mere Jewish hero, but was regarded as an ancestor of the
whole Israelitish nation. For the whole of Israel, Isaac was
no less historical than Abraham or Jacob.</p>

<p class='c003'>That Isaac’s dwelling-place should have been in the desert
of the south agrees well with the fact that he was the father of
Edom as well as of Israel. He thus lived on the borderland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>of the two peoples who afterwards boasted of their descent
from him.</p>

<p class='c003'>Esau, from whom the Edomites traced their origin, was the
elder of his two twin sons. The name has been connected
with that of the Phœnician deity Usous, but Usous is really
the eponymous god of the city of Usu, in the neighbourhood
of Tyre. Esau took possession of the mountains of Seir.
Here he partly absorbed, partly destroyed the older races, the
Amalekites or Bedâwin whose descendants still prowl among
the wadis of Edom, and the Horites whom a somewhat doubtful
etymology would turn into Troglodytes or dwellers in caves.
Edom itself, the ‘Red’ land, took its name from the red hue
of its cliffs. It was a name which went back to a remote
antiquity, for among the Egyptians also the desert-country
which stretched away eastward into Edom was known as
Desher, ‘the Red.’ The punning etymology in Genesis
(<abbr title='twenty-five'>xxv.</abbr> 30) preserves a recollection of the true origin of the
name.</p>

<p class='c003'>The territories of Esau extended southward to the head of
the Gulf of Aqaba. Here were the towns of Elath and Eziongeber,
through which the merchandise of the Indian Ocean
was conveyed northward, enriching the merchants and princes
of Edom in its passage through their land. To the north
Edom was in touch with the peoples of Canaan. The wives
of Esau, we are told, were ‘of the daughters of Canaan’
(<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-six'>xxxvi.</abbr> 2); one of them at least was Hittite, and another,
according to one account (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-six'>xxvi.</abbr> 34), bore the name of
the ‘Jewess.’ But other wives were taken from the tribes of
Arabia. Bashemath was the daughter of Ishmael and sister
of a Nabathean chief, while Aholibamah was the daughter of
a Horite who belonged to the primeval race of Seir.</p>

<p class='c003'>Like the Ishmaelites, like the Israelites themselves, it was
long before the Edomites submitted to the rule of a king.
At first they were divided into tribes, each of them under a
shêkh. In Israel the shêkhs were entitled ‘judges,’ a title
borrowed from the Canaanite population; in Edom they bore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the name of <i>alûphim</i>, which the Authorised Version renders by
‘dukes.’<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c013'><sup>[76]</sup></a> The old name still survived down to the time of
the Exodus, as we may gather from its use in the Song
of Moses (<abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 15). But when the wanderings in the
wilderness were almost over, and Israel was preparing to
invade Palestine, the ‘dukes’ of Edom had already been
superseded by kings. It was a ‘king of Edom’ to whom
Moses sent messengers from Kadesh praying for a ‘passage
through his border,’ and it was a king of Edom who refused
the request. But the ancient spirit of independence still
lingered; and, as we may gather from the extract from the
Edomite chronicles preserved in <abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-six'>xxxvi.</abbr>, the monarchy
was elective. The son never succeeded the father on the
throne, the royal dignity passed from one division of the
kingdom to the other, and each city in turn became the
capital.<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c013'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Though Esau was the elder, the birthright passed to the
younger brother. Israelitish tradition knew of more than one
occurrence which accounted for this. It was told how Esau
had sold his birthright for a mess of pottage; it was also told
how it had been stolen from him by the craft of his brother
Jacob. Naturally, the first tradition was more favoured in
Israel, the second in Edom, and the union of the two in the
book of Genesis is a proof of the diligence with which
the writer of it has gathered together all that was known
of the past of his people as well as the impartiality with which
he has used his materials. Perhaps both stories owed their
preservation to the play upon words which was connected
with them. The ‘red’ pottage served to explain the name of
Edom, the craft of the younger son the name of Jacob.<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c013'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Upon the real origin of the latter name, however, recent
discovery has thrown light. It is the third person singular of
a verb, and is formed like numerous names of the same class
in Arabic and Assyrian. But the third person singular of a
verb implies a nominative, and the nominative was originally
a divine name or title. In familiar use the nominative came
to be dropped, and the shortened form of the name to be
alone employed. The older form of the name Jacob has
now been recovered from the monuments of Babylonia and
Egypt. Among the Canaanites who appear as witnesses to
Babylonian contracts of the age of Khammu-rabi, Mr. Pinches
has found a Jacob-el and a Joseph-el, ‘God will recompense,’
‘God will add.’<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c013'><sup>[79]</sup></a> The same names, though written a little
differently,<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c013'><sup>[80]</sup></a> are met with in contracts earlier than the time
of Moses, which have been discovered near Kaisariyeh, in
Cappadocia, and are inscribed on clay tablets in cuneiform
characters and in a Babylonian dialect. We can thus trace
them from the primitive home of Abraham to the neighbourhood
of that Aramæan district of Northern Mesopotamia in
which his father settled.</p>

<p class='c003'>But this is not all. Among the places in Palestine
conquered by Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> of the eighteenth Egyptian dynasty,
and recorded on the walls of his temple at Karnak, we find
a Jacob-el and a Joseph-el. In Canaan, therefore, the
names were already current; it may even be that in the
town of Jacob-el we have a reminiscence of the patriarch,
in Joseph-el a connection with the ancestor of the ‘House
of Joseph.’ At all events, the name of Joseph-el follows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>immediately after that of the ‘Har’ or ‘Mountain’ of
Ephraim, while that of Jacob-el is placed in the neighbourhood
of Hebron.<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c013'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The name of Jacob-el can be carried still further back
than the age of Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>, further back probably than
the age of the patriarch himself. There are Egyptian
scarabs which bear the name of a Pharaoh called Jacob-el.
The first part of the name is written just as it would be
in Hebrew, and the Pharaoh is given all the titles of a
legitimate Egyptian king. On one he is ‘the good God,’
on another ‘the son of the Sun,’ and ‘the giver of life.’
The scarabs belong to the period of the Hyksos, and in
the Pharaoh Jacob-el we must accordingly see one of those
Hyksos conquerors from Asia who ruled over Egypt for so
many centuries. There was thus a Jacob in Egypt before
the patriarch migrated there, and he belonged to that
Hyksos race under whom Joseph rose to the highest honours
of the state.<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c013'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The shortened form of the name is also found in the
Babylonian texts; and it is probable that Egibi, the founder
of the great banking and trading firm which carried on
business in Babylonia down to the time of the Persian kings,
had a name which is identical with it. At any rate the older
forms of both ‘Jacob’ and ‘Joseph’ show that ‘Isaac’ too
must be an abbreviation from an earlier ‘Isaac-el’ (<i>Yitskhaq-êl</i>).
‘God smileth’ would have been the primitive signification of
the word.</p>

<p class='c003'>The craft of Jacob was the cause of his flight to his mother’s
family in Padan-Aram. He thus became that ‘wandering
Aramæan’ of whom we read in Deuteronomy (<abbr title='twenty-six'>xxvi.</abbr> 5). On
his way he rested at the great Beth-el of Central Palestine,
and there in a vision beheld the angels of God ascending and
descending the steps of limestone that were piled one upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>the other to the gates of heaven.<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c013'><sup>[83]</sup></a> There, too, he poured oil
upon the sacred stone and consecrated it to the deity, and
future generations revered it as a veritable Beth-el or ‘House
of God.’</p>

<p class='c003'>The name, in fact, we are told, was given to it by Jacob
himself. ‘If I come again to my father’s house in peace,’ he
said, ‘then shall Yahveh be my God: and this stone, which I
have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house; and of all that
Thou shalt give me, I will surely give the tenth unto Thee.’
The vow was in accordance with a Canaanitish custom which
had originally come from Babylonia. From time immemorial
the Babylonian temples had been supported by the tenth or
tithe, which was levied on both king and people: it was not
thought that the gods were asking too much when they
demanded the tenth of the income which had been given to
man by themselves. Among the Babylonian contract-tablets
there are several which relate to the payment of the tithe as
well as to the gifts that were made to a Bit-ili or Beth-el.<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c013'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Jacob’s vow was performed, at least in part, when once
more he returned to Canaan. Then again ‘God appeared to
him’ and changed the patriarch’s name. Then again, too, ‘he
set up a pillar of stone; and he poured a drink-offering
thereon, and he poured oil thereon. And Jacob called the
name of the place where God spake with him Beth-el.’ This
second account of the naming of the place doubtless comes
from a different source from that which recorded Jacob’s
dream, and is the account which was known to Hosea, the
prophet of the northern kingdom. Modern critics have alleged
that it is inconsistent with the first, and that consequently
neither the one nor the other is historical. The compiler of
the book of Genesis, however, thought otherwise; he has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>made no attempt to smooth over what the European scholar
declares to be inconsistencies, and which therefore cannot
have seemed inconsistencies to him. The Oriental mode of
writing history, it must once more be remarked, is not the
same as ours; and as it is with the ancient East that we are
now concerned, it would be wiser to follow the judgment of
the writer of Genesis than that of his European critics.</p>

<p class='c003'>At Harran Jacob served his cousin Laban ‘for a wife, and
for a wife he kept sheep.’ Such contracts of voluntary service
are to be found in the Babylonian tablets of the age of
Khammu-rabi and his predecessors. It was not at all unusual
for a slave to be hired out to another master for a definite
period of time; it sometimes happened that the master himself
hired out his own services in a similar way.<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c013'><sup>[85]</sup></a> In Babylonia
the work was partly pastoral, partly agricultural; the semi-Bedâwi
Jacob was a herdsman only. His cousin Laban bore
a name which was also that of an Assyrian deity; and it may
not be a mere coincidence that when Nabonidos, the last king
of Babylonia, restored the great temple of the moon-god at
Harran, he tells us that he began the task ‘by the art of the
god Laban, the god of foundations and brickwork.’<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c013'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The two daughters of Laban bore names which had a
familiar sound to the ear of a herdsman. Rachel means
‘ewe’; Leah is the Assyrian <i>li’tu</i>, ‘a cow.’ It is needless to
recount the well-known story of the wooing of the younger
daughter, and of the efforts made by Laban to retain Jacob in
his service and marry both the sisters to him. Craft was met
by craft; but in the end the ancestor of Israel proved more
than a match for the wily Syrian. His cattle and riches
multiplied like the children who were born to him, and a time
came when the sons of Laban began to view with envy the
poor relative who was robbing them of their patrimony. So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Jacob fled, before harm had come to him, carrying with him
his wives and children and all the wealth he had accumulated.
Laban pursued and succeeded in overtaking the heavily-weighted
caravan at the very spot where the frontiers of Aram
and Canaan met together. There the cairn of stones was
raised in which later generations saw a memorial of the pact
that had been sworn between Jacob and his father-in-law.
Henceforth the tie with Aram was broken: the wives of Jacob
forgot the home of their father and looked to Canaan instead
of Aram as the native land of their race. Over the cairn of
Gilead the forefathers of Israel forswore for ever their
Aramæan ties.</p>

<p class='c003'>But Rachel had carried with her her father’s teraphim, those
household gods on whose cult the welfare of the family seemed
to depend. What they were like we may gather from the
teraphim of David, which Michal placed on the couch of her
husband, and so deceived the messengers of Saul (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='nineteen'>xix.</abbr>
13-16). They must have had the shape of a man, and, at all
events in the case of those of David, must have also been
about a man’s size. Like the ephod and the Urim and
Thummim, they were consulted as oracles (<abbr title='Zechariah'>Zech.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'>x.</abbr> 2), and
their use lingered among the Jews as late as the period of the
Captivity. When Hosea depicts the coming desolation of
Israel, he describes it as a time when ‘the children of Israel
shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince,
and without a sacrifice, and without a sacred pillar, and without
an ephod and teraphim’ (<abbr title='Hosea'>Hos.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 4).</p>

<p class='c003'>The final break between Jacob and the Aramæan portion of
Terah’s family was marked by a change of name. From
henceforth Jacob was to be distinctively the father of the
children of Israel. He and his descendants were severed from
the rest of their kinsmen whether in Padan-Aram, in Edom, or
in the lands beyond the Jordan. Abraham had been the ‘father
of many nations’; Jacob was to be the father of but one—of
that chosen people to whom the character and worship of
Yahveh were revealed.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>We read of him in Hosea (<abbr title='twelve'>xii.</abbr> 3, 4), ‘By his strength he
had power with God: yea, he had power over the angel, and
prevailed.’ What the Authorised Version translates ‘had
power’ is <span lang="hbo"><i>sârâh</i></span> and <span lang="hbo"><i>yâsar</i></span> in Hebrew. The story of the
mysterious struggle is told in full in the book of Genesis.
The long caravan of Jacob had arrived at length at Mahanaim,
‘the two camps’ by the stream of the Jabbok, and from thence
he sent messengers to his brother, who had already established
his power in the mountains of Seir. In after days the name
of the place was connected with the strange occurrence that
there befel the patriarch. He was visited by the angels of
God, nay, by God Himself. In the visions of the night he
wrestled with one whom, when morning dawned, he believed
to have been his God. He had seen God, as it were, face to
face, and a popular etymology saw in the fact an explanation
of the name of Peniel. When Hosea wrote his prophecies,
the belief was too well established that man cannot ‘see God’s
face and live,’ and the angel of God accordingly takes the
place of God Himself. But when the narrative in Genesis
was composed, a more primitive conception of the Divine
nature still prevailed, and no reluctance was felt in stating
exactly what the patriarch himself had believed. It was God
with whom he had struggled, and from whom he had extorted
a blessing, and a memory of the conflict and victory was preserved
in the name of Israel, which Jacob henceforth bore.</p>

<p class='c003'>The etymology, however, is really only one of those plays
upon words of which the Biblical writers, like Oriental writers
generally, are so fond. It has no scientific value, and never
was intended to have any. Israel is, like Edom, not the name
of an individual, but of the people of whom the individual was
the ancestor. The name is formed like that of Jacob-el, and
the abbreviated Jeshurun is used instead of it in the Song of
Moses.<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c013'><sup>[87]</sup></a> If the latter is correct, the root will not be <span lang="hbo"><i>sârâh</i></span>,
‘he fought,’ or <span lang="hbo"><i>yâsar</i></span>, ‘he is king,’ but <span lang="hbo"><i>yâshar</i></span>, ‘to be upright,’
‘to direct’; and Israel will signify ‘God has directed.’ Israel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>in fact, will be the ‘righteous’ people who have been called
to walk in the ways of the Lord.</p>

<p class='c003'>While Jacob was keeping the sheep of his Aramæan father-in-law,
Esau was making a name for himself among the
mountains of the Horites. Half robber, half huntsman, he
had gathered about him a band of followers, and with their
help had founded—if not a kingdom—at all events a nation
to the south of Moab. It is true that the ‘red’ land he had
occupied was rocky and barren, but the high-road of commerce
from the spice-bearing regions of Southern Arabia passed
through it, and the plunder or tribute of the merchants who
travelled along it brought wealth to him and his well-armed
Bedâwin. What David did in later days, when he made himself
the head of a band of outlaws, and with their assistance
eventually raised himself to the throne of Judah, had already
been accomplished by Esau among the barbarians of Seir.</p>

<p class='c003'>The message of Jacob led him northward by the desert road
which ran to the east of Moab and Ammon. It is clear from
the story that Jacob knew little about his brother’s power.
When news was brought that he was coming with a troop of
four hundred men, Jacob’s heart sank within him, and his
only thought was how to save himself and at least a portion
of his wealth from the powerful robber-chief. The event
proved that his precautions were needless. Esau behaved
with a magnanimity which it must have been hard for a
Hebrew writer to describe, and pressed his brother to accompany
him to Seir. Jacob feared to accept the invitation,
and equally feared to refuse it. With characteristic caution
and craft, he promised to come, but urged that the cattle and
children that were with him made it necessary to follow slowly
in Esau’s track. So the Edomite chieftain departed, and
Jacob took good care to turn westward across the Jordan into
the land of Canaan. There, among the cities and fields of
the civilised ‘Amorite,’ he felt himself secure from the pursuit
of the desert tribes.</p>

<p class='c003'>Was it fear of Esau which kept him in Central Palestine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>and prevented him so long from venturing near that southern
part of the country where his father and grandfather had
mainly dwelt? At all events, while Abraham had bought
land at Hebron, the land purchased by Jacob was near
Shechem. Moreover, it was the ‘parcel of a field where he
had spread his tent,’ not a burying-place for his family. It
would seem, therefore, that it was intended for a permanent
residence; here the patriarch determined to settle and to
exchange the free life of the pastoral nomad for that of a
villager of Canaan.<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c013'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The field was bought from Hamor the father of Shechem,
the founder of the city which was destined to become the seat
of the first monarchy in Israel, and on it was raised the first
altar consecrated to the God of Israel. <span lang="hbo">El-elohê-Israel</span>, ‘El is
the God of Israel,’ the altar was termed, a declaration that the El
whom the Canaanites worshipped was the God of Israel as well.
But though the field was bought for one hundred ‘pieces of
money’—an expression, be it noted, which is not Babylonian—we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>are assured also that Jacob had gained land at Shechem
by the right of conquest. In blessing Joseph he declared to
him that to the tribe of his favourite son there was given ‘a
Shechem above’ his ‘brethren which’ he had taken ‘out of
the hand of the Amorite with’ his ‘sword and bow’ (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr>
<abbr title='forty-eight'>xlviii.</abbr> 22); and the story of the ravishment of Dinah recounts
how the sons of the patriarch massacred the men of the city,
how they enslaved their women and carried away their goods.
The terrible tale of vengeance was never forgotten; it is
alluded to in the Blessing of Jacob (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='forty-nine'>xlix.</abbr> 5-7), and the
disappearance of Simeon and Levi as separate tribes was
looked upon as a punishment for the deed. It would seem
that after the Israelitish conquest of Canaan the population
of Shechem remained half Canaanite, half Israelite,<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c013'><sup>[89]</sup></a> and the
Canaanitish population would naturally remember with horror
and indignation the crime of the sons of Jacob. That the
deed should have been attributed to the ancestors of two of
the southern tribes instead of to those of Issachar or some
other tribe of the north is evidence in favour of its truthfulness.</p>

<p class='c003'>The sons of Jacob were twelve in number, like the twelve
sons of Ishmael, and corresponded with the twelve tribes of
Israel which were called after their names. And yet the
correspondence required a little forcing. It is questionable
whether, at any one time, there ever were exactly twelve
Israelitish tribes. In the Song of Deborah Judah does not
appear at all, Ephraim taking its place and, along with
Benjamin, extending as far south as the desert of the Amalekites,
while Machir is substituted for Manasseh and Gad.
Levi never possessed a territory of its own; had it done so,
the tribes would have been thirteen in number and not twelve.
At the same time, it had just as much right to be considered
a separate tribe as Dan, whose cities were in the north as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>as in the south, where, however, they were absorbed by Judah;
more right perhaps than Simeon, which hardly existed except
in name. The territory of Reuben lay outside the boundaries
of Palestine, and was merely the desert-wadis and grazing-grounds
of the kingdom of Moab; the country can be said to
have belonged to the tribe only in the sense that the wadis
east of the Delta belong to the Bedâwin, whom the Egyptian
government at present allows to live in them. Manasseh,
lastly, was divided into two halves, in order to bring the
number of tribes up to the requisite figure.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is clear that the scheme is an artificial one. Israel, after
its conquest of Canaan, could indeed be divided into twelve
separate parts, but such a division was theoretical only. There
were no twelve territories corresponding to the parts, while the
parts themselves could be reckoned as thirteen, eleven, or ten,
just as easily as twelve.</p>

<p class='c003'>The conclusion to be drawn from this is obvious. History
credited Jacob with twelve sons, and it was consequently
necessary to bring the number of Israelitish tribes into harmony
with the fact. Modern criticism has amused itself with reversing
the history, and assuming that the twelve sons of the
patriarch owed their origin to the twelve tribes. It has
accordingly drawn inferences from the fact that some of the
sons of Jacob are said to have been the offspring of concubines,
and not of his two legitimate wives, and that Joseph and
Benjamin were the youngest of all. But such inferences fall
with the assumption that in the twelve sons we have merely
the eponymous heroes of the twelve tribes. It is a cheap
way of making history, and, after all, what we know of the
tribes does not fit in with the theory. There is nothing in the
history of Dan and Naphtali, or Gad and Asher, which would
have caused them to be regarded of bastard descent, if that
bastard descent had not been a fact; indeed, in the Song of
Deborah, which is almost universally allowed to go back to
the early age of the Judges, Naphtali and Zebulun are placed
on exactly the same footing. The distinction between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>sons of Leah and those of Rachel does not answer to the real
cleavage between the tribes of the south and those of the
north of Palestine: Benjamin, after the age of Saul, followed
Judah and Simeon, while the sons of Joseph were joined
with Zebulun and Issachar. Moreover, had the sons of Jacob
been mere reflections of the tribes, it would be difficult to
account for the existence of Joseph, or to understand why
Machir takes the place of Manasseh and Gad in the Song
of Deborah.</p>

<p class='c003'>The critical theory is the result of introducing Greek modes
of thought into Semitic history. The Greek tribe, it is true,
traced its origin to an eponymous ancestor, but that ancestor
was a god or a hero, and not a man. Among the Semites,
however, as the history of Arabia may still teach us, the conception
of the tribe was something wholly different. The
tribe was an enlarged family which called itself by the name
of its first head. It began with the individual, and to the last
styled itself his children. The Greek tribe, on the contrary,
began with the clan, and its theoretical ancestor, accordingly,
was merely the divine personage whose common cult kept it
together. In the Semitic tribe there could be no cult of its
ancestor, for the ancestor was but an ordinary man, who
worshipped the same form of Baal and used the same rites as
his descendants after him.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nevertheless, there may be an element of truth in the
‘critical’ assumption. The names of the ancestors of some
of the Israelitish tribes may have been the reflex of the later
names of the tribes themselves. It does not follow that the
name by which one of the sons of Jacob became known to
later generations was actually the name which he bore himself.
Had Jacob been uniformly called Israel by the Hebrew writers,
we should never have known his original name. And it is
possible that the name of Asher is really a reflex of this kind.
The <i>Travels of the Mohar</i>, written in Egypt in the reign of
Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> before the Israelitish conquest of Canaan, speak
of ‘the mountain of User’ as being in the very locality in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>which the tribe of Asher was afterwards settled. And in the
case of one tribe at least there is evidence that its name must
have been reflected back upon that of its progenitor.</p>

<p class='c003'>This is the tribe of Benjamin. In the book of Genesis
(<abbr title='thirty-five'>xxxv.</abbr> 18) Benjamin is represented as having received two
different names at his birth. The statement excites our
suspicion, for such a double naming is inconsistent with
Hebrew practice, and our suspicion is confirmed when we find
that both names have a geographical meaning. Benjamin is
‘the son of the South’ or ‘Southerner’; Ben-Oni, as he is also
said to have been called, is ‘the son of On,’ or ‘the Onite.’
On, or Beth-On, it will be remembered, was an ancient name
of Beth-el, the great sanctuary and centre of the tribe of
Benjamin, while ‘the Southerner’ was an appropriate title for
the lesser brother tribe which lay to the south of the dominant
Ephraim. It is of Ephraim that Deborah says, in her Song
of Triumph, ‘Behind thee is Benjamin among thy peoples’
(<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v.</abbr> 14).</p>

<p class='c003'>The etymology suggested in Genesis for the name of Ben-Oni
is a sample of those plays upon words in which Oriental
writers have always delighted, and of which the Hebrew
Scriptures contain so many illustrations. They all spring
from the old confusion between the name and the thing, which
substituted the name for the thing, and believed that if the
name could be explained, the thing would be explained also.
Hence the slight transformations in the form of names which
allowed them to be assimilated to familiar words, or their
identification with words which obviously gave an incorrect
sense. Hence, too, the choice of etymologies which was
offered to the reader: where the real origin of the name was
unknown or uncertain, it was possible to explain it in more than
one way. Isaiah (<abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 9) changes the name of the Moabite city
of Dibon into Dimon in order to connect it with the Hebrew
<span lang="hbo"><i>dâm</i></span>, ‘blood,’ and the writer of Genesis gives two contradictory
derivations of the name of Joseph (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty'>xxx.</abbr> 23, 24). The
latter fact is of itself a sufficient proof of the true value of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>etymologies, or rather, popular plays upon words, and the sayings
in which they are embodied can still be matched by the
traveller in the East. Similar embodiments of popular etymologising
are still repeated to explain the place-names of Egypt.<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c013'><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The origin of some of the names of the sons of Jacob is as
obscure to us as it was to the writer of Genesis. We do not
know, for instance, the meaning and derivation of the name of
Reuben. Equally doubtful is the real etymology of the name
of Issachar.<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c013'><sup>[91]</sup></a> The name of Simeon is already found among
the places in Canaan conquered by the Egyptian Pharaoh
Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> before the age of Moses, and in Judah we
have a name which seems to be the same as that of a tribe in
Northern Syria.<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c013'><sup>[92]</sup></a> Levi, like Naphtali, is a gentilic noun, and
must be connected with the <i>lau’â(n)</i>, or ‘priest’ of Southern
Arabia.<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c013'><sup>[93]</sup></a> Gad was the god of good fortune, Dan ‘the judge,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>the title of certain Babylonian deities, and Dinah is the feminine
corresponding to Dan.</p>

<p class='c003'>Jacob, ever timorous, fled from Hivite vengeance after
the destruction of Shechem, forsaking the property he had
acquired there by purchase and the sword. He made his
way southward to Beth-el, and there rested on the edge of the
great mountain block of Central Palestine. Hard by was the
city of Luz, soon to be eclipsed by the growing fame of the
high-place on the height above it. Here, at Beth-el, an altar
was erected by the patriarch to the God of the locality who
had once appeared to him in a dream. It was the prototype
of the altar that was hereafter to arise there when Beth-el had
become a chief sanctuary of the house of Israel. Whether the
altar stood on the high-place on the summit of the mountain,
where the Beth-el or column of stone had been consecrated by
Jacob, we do not know; there are indications in the prophets,
however, that the high-place and the temple were separate from
one another. Indeed, from the words of Genesis, it would
seem that the altar and future temple were on the lower slope
of the hill, close to the old Canaanitish town. Here, at any
rate, on the road to the city, was that Allon-bachuth, that ‘Terebinth
of Tears,’ which is referred to by Hosea (<abbr title='twelve'>xii.</abbr> 4), and is
connected in the book of Genesis with the death of Deborah,
the nurse of Rachel. In later days another Deborah dwelt
under the shadow of a palm-tree on the same road (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv.</abbr> 6),
and modern critical ingenuity has accordingly discovered that
the terebinth and the palm were one and the same tree.</p>

<p class='c003'>Beth-el, however, was still too near the Hivites of Shechem,
and Jacob continued his journey to the south. The death of
Isaac called him to Hebron, where, for the last time, he met
his brother Esau, who came to take part in his father’s burial.
But his own residence was at Beth-lehem, ‘the Temple of the
god Lakhmu,’ called Ephrath in those early days.<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c013'><sup>[94]</sup></a> Here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Rachel died, and here accordingly was raised the tombstone
which marked her grave down to the day when the book of
Genesis assumed its present form.<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c013'><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>It was ‘beyond the tower of Edar,’ the tower of ‘the Flock,’
that Jacob, we are told, ‘spread his tent.’ The tower of the
Flock guarded the city-fortress of Jerusalem (<abbr title='Micah'>Mic.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv.</abbr> 8), and
it was therefore between Jerusalem and Beth-lehem that the
patriarch made his home. But his flocks were scattered
northwards as far as Shechem, grazing on the mountain slopes
under the charge of his sons. Jacob remained like a Bedâwi
of to-day living among the settled inhabitants of the country,
and yet keeping apart from them and sending his flocks far
and wide wherever there was fresh grass and free pasturage.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was while he thus lived that the disgraceful events
occurred connected with the marriage of Judah and the
Canaanitish Tamar, which throw an evil light on the manners
and morals of the patriarch’s family. The whole episode
stands in marked contrast to the ordinary character of the
history, and its insertion is evidence of the impartiality of the
writer. It is clear that he has put together all that reached
him from the past history of his people, omitting nothing,
modifying nothing. All sides of the past are brought before
us, the darker as well as the lighter, and no attempt is made
to spare or condone the forefathers of Israel. It has indeed
been asked by an over-sensitive criticism how the recital of
such abominations can be consistent with the sanctity claimed
for the Mosaic writings. But the question has troubled the
minds only of the critics themselves; and not more than three
centuries ago the compilers of the Anglican lectionary saw no
harm in ordering the chapter to be read publicly to men and
maidens in church.</p>

<p class='c003'>The episode was inserted in the midst of the story of Joseph,
one of the most pathetic and touching ever told. We need
not repeat its details, or describe how Joseph, the spoilt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>darling of his father, dreamed dreams which aroused the
alarm and jealousy of his brothers, how he was sold by them
into Egypt, how there he became the vizier of the Pharaoh,
and how eventually Jacob and his family were brought into
the land of Goshen, there to enjoy the good things of the
valley of the Nile. But the story brings us back again to the
great stream of ancient Oriental history; once more the history
of Israel touches the history of the world, and ceases to be
a series of idyllic pictures, such as the memory of shepherds
and Bedâwin might alone preserve.</p>

<p class='c003'>The story of Joseph forms a complete whole, distinguished
by certain features that mark it off from the rest of the book
of Genesis. It contains peculiar words, some of them of
Egyptian origin,<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c013'><sup>[96]</sup></a> and it shows a very minute acquaintance with
Egyptian life in the Hyksos age. There are even words and
phrases which seem to have been translated into Hebrew from
some other language, and the meaning of which has not been
fully understood: thus it is said that the cupbearer of Pharaoh
‘pressed the grapes’ into his master’s goblet instead of pouring
the wine; and the word employed to denote an Egyptian official,
and translated ‘officer’ in the Authorised Version, properly
signifies ‘eunuch.’ Can the story have been translated from
an Egyptian papyrus? The question is suggested by the fact
that one of the most characteristic portions of it has actually
been embodied in an ancient Egyptian tale. This is the so-called
<i>Tale of the Two Brothers</i>, written by the scribe Enna for
Seti <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> of the nineteenth dynasty while he was crown-prince,
and therefore in the age of the Exodus. Here we have the
episode of Joseph and Potiphar’s wife told in Egyptian form.
The fellah Bata takes the place of Joseph; his sister-in-law
plays the part of Potiphar’s wife.<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c013'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>This part of the story was therefore known among the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>literary classes of Egypt in the days when Moses was learned
in all their wisdom. And if it has been preserved among the
few fragments that have been saved from the wreck of ancient
Egyptian literature, may we not conclude that had the whole
of that literature come down to us, other portions of the story
of Joseph would have been preserved in it as well? There is
a gentleness in the character of Joseph which reminds us
forcibly of Egyptian manners, and offers a sharp contrast to
the rough ways and readiness to shed blood which distinguished
the Hebrew Semite.</p>

<p class='c003'>At all events, the story must have been written by one who
was well acquainted with the age of the Hyksos. It is true
that an attempt has recently been made, on the strength of
certain proper names, to show that it is not the Egypt of the
Hyksos that is described, but the Egypt of Shishak and his
successors. The names of Potipherah or Potiphar and
Asenath are said to have been unknown before that date. A
couple of proper names, however, is an insecure foundation
on which to build a theory, more especially when the
argument rests upon the imperfections of our own knowledge.
That no names corresponding in formation to
Potipherah and Asenath should as yet have been met with
earlier than the time of Shishak is no proof that they did not
exist. A single example of each is sufficient to prove the
contrary. And, as a matter of fact, such examples actually
occur. A stela of the reign of Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> records the
name of Pe-tu-Baal, ‘the Gift of Baal,’ as that of the sixth
ancestor of the Egyptian whose name it records;<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c013'><sup>[98]</sup></a> while the
Tel el-Amarna tablets contain the name of Subanda, the
Smendes of Greek writers, which is an exact parallel in form
to Asenath.<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c013'><sup>[99]</sup></a> Pe-tu-Baal must have lived at the close of the
Hyksos period, and the Semitic deity with whose name his
own is compounded indicates that it has been formed under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Semitic influence. It was, in fact, as we learn from the
Phœnician inscriptions, an imitation of a Canaanitish name.<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c013'><sup>[100]</sup></a>
The Hyksos had come from Asia, and had imposed their yoke
upon Egypt, where they ruled for more than five hundred years.
Though they held all Egypt under their sway, they had established
their capital at Zoan, now called Sân, far to the north
on the eastern frontier of the Delta. Here they were near
their kinsfolk in Canaan, and could readily summon fresh
troops from Asia in case of Egyptian revolt.</p>

<p class='c003'>The court of the Hyksos Pharaohs, however, soon became
Egyptianised. They adopted the arts and science, the
manners and customs, of their more cultured subjects, and
one of the few scientific works of ancient Egypt that have
come down to us—the famous <i>Mathematical Papyrus</i>—was
written for a Hyksos king. It was only in physiognomy and
religion that the Hyksos conqueror continued to be distinguished
from the native Egyptian.</p>

<p class='c003'>Besides Zoan, Heliopolis, or ‘On of the North,’ was a chief
centre of Hyksos power. It was the oldest and most celebrated
sanctuary of Egypt, where ancient schools of learning
were established, and from whence the religious system had
been disseminated which made the Sun-god the supreme
ruler of the universe. The Hyksos had no difficulty in
identifying the Sun-god of On with their own supreme deity
Sutekh, who was a form of the Canaanitish Baal. On, consequently,
once the chief seat of the orthodox faith of Egypt,
became the centre of foreign heresy. The Sallier Papyrus,
which describes the origin of the war that resulted in the
expulsion of the Hyksos, specially tells us that ‘the Impure of
(On), the city of Ra, were subject to Ra-Apopi,’ the Hyksos
Pharaoh, and the Egyptians changed into Ra, the Egyptian
Sun-god, the name of Sutekh, which a scarab of Apopi shows
was really prefixed to that Pharaoh’s name.<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c013'><sup>[101]</sup></a> The great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>temple of the Sun-god of On, accordingly, before which
Usertesen of the twelfth dynasty had planted the obelisks,
one of which remains to this day, was transformed into a
temple of the foreign god; and though its high-priest still
continued to bear his ancient title, and perform the ceremonies
of the past, it was Sutekh and not the native divinity whom he
served. Potipherah—in Egyptian, Pa-tu-pa-Ra—was a literal
translation of the Canaanitish Mattan-Baal, ‘the gift of Baal,’
and implied of itself the foreign cult.</p>

<p class='c003'>Potiphar is an abbreviation of Potipherah, and reminds
us of similar abbreviations met with in the letters of the
Canaanitish correspondents of the Pharaoh in the Tel el-Amarna
collection. It is an abbreviation which points to
long familiarity with the name on the part of the Hebrew
people. The titles, however, given to Potiphar are obscure.
The second seems to signify ‘captain of the bodyguard,’ but
the first—<span lang="hbo"><i>saris</i></span> in Hebrew—means an ‘eunuch.’ Ebers, it is
true, has pointed out that eunuchs in the East have not only
held high positions of state, but have married wives as well;<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c013'><sup>[102]</sup></a>
this, however, has been in Turkey, not in ancient Egypt.
Perhaps the word is the Babylonian <i>saris</i>, ‘an officer’; at all
events, the Rab-sarîs of 2 Kings <abbr title='eighteen'>xviii.</abbr> 17 is the Assyrian Rab-sarisi,
or ‘chief officer.’ That Babylonian words should have
made their way into Egypt in the age of the Hyksos is by no
means strange. We have learned from the Tel el-Amarna
tablets that Babylonian was for centuries the literary language
of Western Asia, and was studied and written even on the
banks of the Nile, while the monuments of Babylonia itself
have shown that Babylonian culture had made its way to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>frontiers of Egypt at a very remote age. The history of
Joseph contains at least one word which bears testimony to
its influence. When Joseph was made ‘governor over all the
land of Egypt,’ the heralds who ran before his chariot to
announce the fact shouted the word ‘abrêk!’ For this word
no explanation can be found either in Hebrew or in Egyptian.
But the language of the Babylonian inscriptions has unexpectedly
come to our aid. In Chaldæa <i>abarakku</i> was the title
of one of the highest officers of State, and <i>abriqqu</i>, borrowed
from the earlier Sumerian <i>abrik</i>, signified ‘a seer.’</p>

<p class='c003'>We have said that the history of Joseph is marvellously true
in all its details to what archæology has informed us were the
facts of Egyptian life. Thus the prison in which ‘the king’s
prisoners’ were confined is called by the strange name of ‘the
round house.’ Such, at least, would seem to be the literal
meaning of the Hebrew phrase, the second element of which
signifies ‘roundness.’ The word is written <span lang="hbo"><i>sohar</i></span>, though
there is evidence of another reading, <span lang="hbo"><i>sokhar</i></span>. <span lang="hbo"><i>Sohar</i></span> or <span lang="hbo"><i>sokhar</i></span>,
however, is really an Egyptian word. The royal prison at
Thebes, where the State prisoners were kept under guard, was:
called <i>suhan</i>, in which we have the same interchange of final
<i>r</i> and <i>n</i> that is still a characteristic of Egyptian Arabic.<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c013'><sup>[103]</sup></a> The
term <i>bêth has-sohar</i>, ‘the house of the Sohar,’ is found nowhere
else in the Old Testament: it is, in fact, one of the peculiarities
which distinguish the story of Joseph, and at the same
time testify to the acquaintance of its writer with the details
of Egyptian life.</p>

<p class='c003'>The titles of the royal cupbearer and the chief of the bakers
have been found in the lists of Egyptian officials; the
Pharaoh’s kitchen was organised on an elaborate scale;<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c013'><sup>[104]</sup></a> and
the Egyptians were famed for their skill in confectionery and
in making various kinds of bread.<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c013'><sup>[105]</sup></a> On the monuments we
may see depicted the cupbearer offering the goblet of wine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>and the baker carrying on his head the baskets filled with
round ‘white loaves.’ The ‘birthday of the Pharaoh’ was a
general festival, on which, as the decrees of Rosetta and
Canopus have taught us, the sovereign proclaimed an amnesty
and released such prisoners as were thought deserving of
pardon.<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c013'><sup>[106]</sup></a> The dreams that Pharaoh dreamed are in full
accordance with Egyptian mythology and symbolism. The
seven kine fitly represent the Nile, which from time immemorial
had been likened to a milch-cow. The cow-headed
goddess Hathor or Isis watched over the fertility of the
country, and the fertilising water of the river was called the
milk that flowed from her breasts. The number seven
denotes the ‘seven great Hathors,’ the seven forms under
which the goddess was adored. The dreams themselves fall
in with the Egyptian belief of the age. Throughout Egyptian
history they have been a power not only in religion, but in
politics as well. It was in consequence of a dream that
Thothmes <abbr title='the fourth'><span class='fss'>IV.</span></abbr> cleared away the sand from before the paws
of the Sphinx, and a thousand years later Nut-Amon of
Ethiopia was summoned by a dream to invade Egypt. The
dreams usually needed an interpreter to explain them, such as
is mentioned in a Greek inscription from the Serapeum at
Memphis. Books, however, had been compiled in which the
signification of dreams was reduced to a science; and as in
modern Egypt, so yet more in the past, men spent their
lives in pondering over the signification of the dreams of the
night.<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c013'><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Even the statement that the east wind had blasted the
ears of corn (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='forty-one'>xli.</abbr> 6) betrays an acquaintance with the
peculiarities of the Egyptian climate. Those who have sailed
up the Nile know that the wind feared alike by the peasant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and the sailor is that which blows from the south-east; while
the crops of spring are matured by the northern breeze, they are
parched and destroyed by the evil wind from the south-east.</p>

<p class='c003'>The golden collar placed around the neck of the royal
favourite is equally characteristic of Egyptian customs, at all
events in the age of the Hyksos and the eighteenth dynasty.
‘Captain’ Ahmes, whose tomb is at El-Kab, and who took a
prominent part in the final struggle which drove the Hyksos
strangers out of the Delta, describes the rewards bestowed
upon him by the Pharaoh for his deeds of valour, and chief
among the rewards are the chains of gold. Before Joseph
was allowed to enter the presence of the monarch, he was not
only clad in new raiment, but shorn as well. This, too, was
in accordance with Egyptian custom. None could appear
before Pharaoh unless they had been freshly shaven, and in
the eyes of the Egyptian not the least part of the ‘impurity’
of the Asiatic Semite was his habit of growing a beard.<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c013'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The change of name, moreover, which marked Joseph’s
elevation was again characteristic of Egypt. The monuments
have told us of other cases in which an Asiatic from Canaan,
or a Karian from Asia Minor, became an Egyptian official,
and in so doing was required to adopt an Egyptian name.<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c013'><sup>[109]</sup></a>
That the name of Zaphnath-paaneah is of Egyptian origin has
long been recognised, and that it contains the Egyptian
<i>pa-ânkh</i>, ‘life’ or ‘the living one,’ is clear. It is only over its
first elements that discussion is possible.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is hardly necessary to notice further points which prove how
intimately the writer of the history of Joseph was acquainted
with Egyptian life and manners, language and soil. The
Egyptians, he notes, could not eat together with the Hebrews,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>for that would have been ‘an abomination’ to them. It
would, indeed, have defiled them ceremonially, and have caused
them to participate in the impurity of those whom they termed
‘the unclean.’ So, too, we read, ‘every shepherd is an abomination
to the Egyptians,’ not indeed, as has been imagined,
because Egypt had been conquered by the ‘Shepherd’ kings,
but because the flocks of the Delta were tended partly by
Bedâwin, partly by half-caste Egyptians, whose unclean habits
and unshorn faces were the butt of the literary world. The
‘marshmen,’ as they were contemptuously called, were looked
upon as pariahs.<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c013'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>While, however, the narrative is thus thoroughly Egyptian
in character, the Egypt it brings before us is the Egypt of the
age of the Hyksos. Chariots and horses have already been
introduced. It has been supposed that the horse came with
the Hyksos; at all events, there is no trace of it before the
conquest of the country by the Asiatic stranger. The Pharaoh,
moreover, holds his court in the Delta, not far from the
Canaanitish border and the land of Goshen; and the waggons
which carried Jacob and his family travelled easily from
Beth-lehem to the Egyptian capital. Zoan consequently
must still have been the residence of the Pharaoh; and
Thebes, in Upper Egypt, had not as yet taken its place.</p>

<p class='c003'>There is one fact, furthermore, which stands out prominently
in the history of Joseph, and points unmistakably to the
Hyksos age. We are told that it was his policy which reduced
the people of Egypt to the condition of serfs. Pressed by
famine, they were compelled by him to sell their lands for
corn, and to receive it again as tenants of the Pharaoh, with
the obligation of paying him a fifth part of the produce. The
priests, or rather, the temples, were alone allowed to retain
their old possessions; henceforward the land of Egypt was
shared between them and the king. In the language of
modern Egypt, it became either Government property or <i>waqf</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>Now, this fact corresponds with a change in the tenure of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>land which the monuments have informed us must have taken
place under the dominion of the Hyksos dynasties. When
Egypt was conquered by the Asiatics, it was divided among a
number of feudal families who were landowners on a large
scale, and at times the rivals of the sovereign himself. By
the side of this higher aristocracy there was also a lower one,
answering in some measure to the yeomen farmers of the
northern counties, but equally owners of land. When, however,
the Hyksos were finally driven out, a new Egypt comes
into view. The feudal aristocracy has disappeared—or almost
disappeared—along with the other landowners of the country,
and the only proprietors of land that are left are the Pharaoh
and the priests, to whom in after times the military caste was
added. Only in Southern Egypt, where the struggle against
the foreigner first began, do we find instances of private ownership
of land, and this, too, only in the earlier years of the
eighteenth dynasty. Before long the Pharaoh had absorbed
into his own hands all the land that had not been given to
the gods; the old nobility had disappeared, and their place
been taken by an army of officials who derived all their wealth
and power from the king. The Pharaoh, the priests, and the
bureaucracy henceforth are the rulers of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c003'>This momentous change must have had a cause, but we
look in vain for such a cause in the Egyptian monuments. It
has been suggested that the War of Independence may have
brought it about by increasing the power of the king as leader
in the struggle.<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c013'><sup>[111]</sup></a> But this would not explain his absorption of
the land; and even if all the older families had perished in the
war, which is not very probable, the lesser landowners would
have remained. Moreover, the generals of the king would
in this case have claimed similar spoils to those of their leader.
What their commander had seized would have been seized
also by the officers under him.</p>

<p class='c003'>However great may be our reluctance to accept the explanation
offered by the story of Joseph, certain it is that it is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>only adequate explanation forthcoming. And there is one
strong argument in its favour. Under Ahmes, the conqueror
of the Hyksos and the founder of the eighteenth dynasty,
there are still instances of land being held by private individuals.
But this was at El-Kab, in Upper Egypt, where the
Hyksos rule had long been nominal rather than real, and
where it had not been obeyed at all for three generations
previously.<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c013'><sup>[112]</sup></a> As soon as the eighteenth dynasty kings were
established firmly on the throne of the Hyksos Pharaohs in
the north as well as in their ancestral homes in Southern
Egypt, even these instances of individual ownership in land
came to an end. It was only where the Hyksos supremacy
had been weak that they had lingered on. When once the
Prince of Thebes had become in all respects the successor of
the foreign Pharaohs who had reigned at Zoan, they cease
altogether.</p>

<p class='c003'>The account of Joseph’s procedure is true to facts in
another point also. From the time of the eighteenth dynasty
onwards we hear repeatedly of the public <i>larits</i> or granaries
which were under State control.<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c013'><sup>[113]</sup></a> The peasantry were required
to contribute to them yearly in a fixed proportion, and the
corn stored up in them was only sold to the people in case of
need. It was out of these granaries, furthermore, that many
of the Government officials were paid in kind, as well as the
workmen employed by the State. The office of ‘superintendent
of the granaries’ was therefore a very important one:
once each year he presented to the king an ‘account of the
harvests of the south and the north’; and if the account was
exceptionally good, if the inundation had been abundant and
the harvest better than ‘for thirty years,’ his grateful sovereign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>would throw chains of gold around his neck.<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c013'><sup>[114]</sup></a> The origin of
these royal granaries and of the office of their superintendent
which thus characterise the ‘new empire’ of Egypt is explained
by the history of Joseph.</p>

<p class='c003'>Before the days when the conquests of the eighteenth
dynasty had created an Egyptian empire in Asia, and brought
foreign supplies of food to Egypt, the rise of the Nile was a
matter of vital interest. The very existence of the people
depended upon it. Too high a Nile meant scarcity, too low
a Nile famine. It was only when the river rose to its normal
level and overflowed the fields at the stated time that the
heart of the agriculturist was gladdened, and he knew that the
gods had given him a year of plenty.</p>

<p class='c003'>The seven years’ famine of Joseph’s age is not the only
seven years’ famine which Egypt has had to endure. El-Makrîzî,
the Arabic historian of Egypt, describes one which
lasted for seven years, from <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 1064 to 1071, and, like that
of Joseph, was caused by a deficient Nile. A stela discovered
by Mr. Wilbour on the island of Sehêl, in the middle of the
First Cataract, and engraved in the time of the Ptolemies,
similarly records a famine that was wasting the country because
‘the Nile-flood had not come for seven years.’<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c013'><sup>[115]</sup></a> And it is
possible that a memorial of the famine of Joseph has been
discovered by Brugsch in one of the tombs of El-Kab. Here
the dead man, a certain Baba, is made to say, ‘When a
famine arose, lasting many years, I issued out corn to the
city.’ Baba must have lived in the latter part of the Hyksos
domination, so that the date of his inscription would agree
with that of Joseph.<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c013'><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Whether the power of Joseph and his master would still
have extended as far south as El-Kab in the age of Baba, we
do not know. But we do know that a famine which prevailed
in Lower Egypt in consequence of a low Nile would have
equally prevailed in the Thebaid. It would not, however,
have prevailed in Canaan. In Canaan the ground is watered,
not by the Nile, but by the rains of heaven, and in Canaan,
therefore, it was only a want of rain that could have caused a
scarcity of food.</p>

<p class='c003'>Famines, indeed, did occur in Palestine from time to time,
and we hear of Egyptian kings sending corn to that country
to supply its needs.<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c013'><sup>[117]</sup></a> As Egypt was the granary of Italy in
the days of the Roman Empire, so too it had been the granary
of Western Asia in an earlier age. A dry season in Canaan
brought famine in its train; and if that dry season coincided
with a deficient Nile in Egypt, there was no other land to
which its inhabitants could look for food. It is quite possible
that one of these famines in Canaan may have happened at
the very time when the Nile refused to irrigate the fields of
Egypt. When, however, we read that ‘the famine was over
all the face of the earth,’ and that ‘all countries came into
Egypt to Joseph to buy corn because the famine was sore in
all lands,’ it is evident that the narrative has been written from
an Egyptian point of view. The Egyptians might have supposed
that when a low Nile produced a scarcity of food all other
countries would equally suffer—such, indeed, was the case
with Ethiopia—but a supposition of the kind is inconceivable
in the mind of a Canaanite. An inhabitant of Palestine knew
that the crops of his country were dependent on the rain, not
on the waters of the Nile; it was only the Egyptian who
modelled the rest of the world after that part of it which was
known to him.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Here, then, we have a clear indication that the story of
Joseph must have been written in Egypt, and further probability
is added to the theory that it has been translated into
Hebrew from an Egyptian original. But more than this. Is
it likely that the Hebrew translator, if he had been acquainted
with the climate of Canaan, would have left the words of the
story just as we find them? Can we imagine that the language
he employed about the extent of the famine would have been
so definite, so comprehensive, so Egyptian in character? Like
the Egyptian words embodied in the narrative, it points to a
writer or translator who lived in Egypt, and not in Canaan.</p>

<p class='c003'>Who was the Pharaoh under whom Joseph became the first
minister of the State? Chronology shows that he must have
been one of the kings of the last Hyksos dynasty. George
the Syncellus makes him Aphophis, Apopi Ra-aa-kenen, or
Apopi <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> of the monuments, and the date would suit very
well.<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c013'><sup>[118]</sup></a> Apopi <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> was the last powerful Hyksos sovereign.
His authority was still obeyed in Upper Egypt, but it was in
his reign that the War of Independence broke out. According
to the story in the Sallier Papyrus, it was caused by his message
to the <i>hiq</i> or vassal prince of Thebes, requiring him to renounce
the worship of Amon of Thebes and acknowledge Sutekh, the
Hyksos Baal, as his supreme god.<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c013'><sup>[119]</sup></a> The war lasted for four
generations, and ended in the expulsion of the foreigner.</p>

<p class='c003'>But long before this took place the family of Israel was
settled in the land of Goshen, on the outskirts of Northern
Egypt. The geographical position of Goshen has been rediscovered
by Dr. Naville. It corresponded with the modern
Wadi Tumilât, through which the traveller by the railway now
passes on his way from Ismailîyeh to Zagazig. It took its
name from Qosem or Qos, the Pha-kussa of Greek geography,
and the capital of the Arabian nome, the site of which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>marked by the mounds of Saft el-Hennah.<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c013'><sup>[120]</sup></a> The very name
of the ‘Arabian nome’ indicates that its occupants belonged
to Arabia rather than to Egypt. It was, in fact, a district
handed over to the Bedâwin by the Pharaohs, as it still is
to-day. Meneptah, the son of Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, says in his great
inscription at Karnak that ‘the country around Pa-Bailos
(now Belbeis, near Zagazig) was not cultivated, but left as
pasture for cattle, because of the strangers. It was abandoned
since the time of the ancestors.’<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c013'><sup>[121]</sup></a> Abandoned, that is to say,
by the Egyptians themselves. But the Semitic nomad pitched
his tent and fed his flocks there, partly because it was on the
road to his own country and countrymen, partly because it was
fitted for grazing and not for agriculture. Here, too, he was
not in immediate contact with the Egyptian fellah, though the
court of the Hyksos Pharaoh at Zoan was nigh at hand.</p>

<p class='c003'>Joseph’s brethren were made overseers of the royal cattle,
an official post of which we also hear in the native Egyptian
texts. After a while, Jacob died, full of years, and his body
was embalmed in the Egyptian fashion. The actual process
of embalming occupied forty days, the whole period during
which ‘the Egyptians mourned for him,’ being threescore and
ten. The statement is in accordance with other testimony as
to the length of time needed to embalm a mummy. Herodotos
(<abbr title='two'>ii.</abbr> 86) states that the corpse was kept in natron during seventy
days, ‘to which period they are strictly confined.’ According to
Diodoros,<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c013'><sup>[122]</sup></a> ‘oil of cedar and other things were applied to the
whole body for upwards of thirty days,’ the full period during
which the mourning for the dead and the preparation of his
mummy lasted being seventy-two days. Between the age of
Joseph and that of Diodoros it would seem that little change
had taken place in this part, at any rate, of the Egyptian
treatment of their dead. When, however, the Hebrew text
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>states that the corpse was embalmed by ‘the physicians, the
slaves’ of Joseph; the word ‘physicians’ must be understood
in a restricted sense. Pliny,<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c013'><sup>[123]</sup></a> it is true, avers that during the
process of embalming physicians were employed to examine
the body of the dead man and determine of what disease he
had died. But the <i>paraskhistæ</i>, who made the needful incision,
were regarded with the utmost abhorrence; they were
the pariahs of society, who lived in a community apart. It
was the embalmers who were the associates of the priests, and
whose persons, in the words of Diodoros, were looked upon as
‘sacred.’ Nor is it easy to see who could have been the
physicians who were the ‘slaves’ of the Hebrew vizier. The
physician in Egypt was usually a free man, who followed a
profession which brought with it honour and respect. The
doctor belonged to the learned classes, and, like the scribe,
had no mean opinion of his worth and dignity. But such
physicians were employed in healing the sick, not in embalming
the dead, and must have stood in a very different position
from that of Joseph’s ‘slaves.’ More light is still wanted on
the subject from monumental sources; in spite of the papyri
which describe the ceremonies attendant on the various
acts of the embalmment, we are still ignorant of its practical
details.</p>

<p class='c003'>When at last the days of mourning were past, Joseph spoke,
we are told, to ‘the house of Pharaoh.’ The expression is
purely Egyptian, and refers to the signification of the word
‘Pharaoh’ itself. Pharaoh, the Egyptian Per-âa, is the ‘Great
House’; ‘the son of the Sun-god’ was too highly exalted to
be spoken of as a man, and it was therefore to ‘the Great
House’ that his subjects addressed themselves. Modern
Europe is familiar with a similar phrase; when we allude to
the ‘Sublime Porte’ we mean the Turkish Sultan, who once
administered justice from the ‘High Gate’ of his palace.</p>

<p class='c003'>Jacob was buried in the cave of Machpelah. A long procession
of soldiers and mourners, partly in chariots, partly on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>foot, accompanied the mummy on its way out of Egypt. Such
a procession was no unusual thing. The wealthy Egyptian
desired to be buried near the tomb of Osiris at Abydos, and
it was therefore not unfrequently the custom to convey his
mummy in solemn procession to that sacred spot, and then to
carry it back once more to its own final resting-place. The
procession which accompanied the body of the patriarch must
have followed the high-road which led through the Shur, or
line of fortification on the eastern border of the desert, and
brought the traveller with little difficulty to Southern Palestine.
The reference in the narrative to the threshing-floor of Atad,
on the eastern side of the Jordan, is an interpolation, which
embodies merely a local etymology. The chariot-road from
Egypt to Palestine naturally never ran near the Jordan; and
the threshing-floor of Atad would have been far out of the
way. But popular imagination had seen in the name of Abel-Mizraim,
where the threshing-floor was situated, a ‘mourning
of Egypt,’ and had accordingly connected it with the great
mourning that was made for Jacob. As a matter of fact, however,
Abel-Mizraim really signifies ‘the meadow of Egypt,’
<i>abel</i>, ‘a meadow,’ being a not uncommon element in the
geographical names of ancient Canaan.<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c013'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Two sons had been born to Joseph by his Egyptian wife,
whom the Israelites knew by their Hebrew names. They had
been born before the death of his father, and had thus received
his blessing. Joseph himself lived ‘an hundred and ten years.’
This was the limit of life the Egyptian desired for himself and
his friends, and in the inscriptions the boon of a life of ‘an
hundred and ten years’ is from time to time asked for from
the gods. It is the term of existence a court poet promises to
Seti <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> ‘on earth,’ and Ptah-hotep, the author of ‘the oldest
book in the world,’ who flourished in the days of the fifth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>dynasty, assures us that, thanks to his pursuit of wisdom he
had already attained the age.<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c013'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Joseph was embalmed, but his mummy was not carried to
Hebron for burial, like that of his father. If Apopi <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> had
been the Pharaoh who had transformed him from a Hebrew
slave into the highest of Egyptian officials, the War of Independence
must have broken out long before his death. The
Hyksos dynasty was hastening to its decay. Its strength had
departed from it, and the Pharaohs of Zoan, who had lost all
power in Upper Egypt, would still more have lost all power in
Asia. Their soldiers were needed for other purposes than
that of escorting the coffin of the dead vizier across the desert
of El-Arish. Moreover, Joseph was an Egyptian official, and
by his marriage into the family of the high priest of Heliopolis
had become as much of an Egyptian as his Hyksos master.
We are told that he made the Israelites swear to carry his
corpse with them should they ever return to Palestine; the
triumph of the Theban princes was growing more assured, and
Joseph knew well that the vengeance of the victorious party
would be wreaked upon the dead as well as upon the living.
The history of Egypt had already shown that the tomb and
the mummy were the first to suffer.</p>

<p class='c003'>A change of sepulchre was no unheard-of thing. King Ai
of the eighteenth dynasty had two, if not three, tombs made
for himself, and the mummy could be transported from one
place of burial to another. All knew where it was interred;
year by year offerings were made to the spirit of the dead, and
in many cases the estate of the deceased was taxed to support
a line of priests who should perform the stated services at the
tomb. As long as the sepulchre of Joseph was in the neighbourhood
of his people it would have been easy to protect his
mummy from violence, and to carry the coffin out of Egypt
when the needful time should come.</p>

<p class='c004'>The book of Genesis ends with the death of Joseph. When
the five books of the Pentateuch were divided from one
another we do not know. The division is older than the
Septuagint translation, older too than the time when the Law
of Moses was accepted by the Samaritans as divinely authoritative.
As far back as we can trace the external history of the
Pentateuch, it has consisted of five books divided from one
another as they still are in our present Bibles.</p>

<p class='c003'>An influential school of modern critics has come to conclusions
which are difficult to reconcile with this external
testimony. Instead of the Pentateuch it offers us a Hexateuch,
the Book of Joshua being added to those of Moses,
and of the origin and growth of this Hexateuch it professes
to be able to give a minute and mathematically exact
account. Very little, if any of it, we are told, goes back to
the period of Moses, the larger part of the work having
been composed or compiled in the age of the Exile. It
is true, the theories of criticism have changed from time to
time; what was formerly held, for instance, to be the oldest
portion of the Hexateuch being now regarded as the latest;
but each generation of critics has been equally confident that
its own literary analysis was mathematically correct. At present
the hypothetical scheme most in favour is as follows.</p>

<p class='c003'>The earliest part of the Hexateuch, at all events in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>existing form, is a document distinguished by the use of the
name Yahveh, and sometimes therefore termed Yahvistic or
Jehovistic, but more usually designated by the symbol <abbr class='spell'>J</abbr>.
The Yahvist is supposed to have been a Jew who made use of
older materials, and lived in the ninth century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> His work
begins with ‘the second’ account of the Creation, in the middle
of the fourth verse of the second chapter of Genesis, and the
last trace of it is to be found in the story of the death and
burial of Moses at the end of Deuteronomy. His style is said
to be naïve and lively, and his conceptions of the Deity grossly
anthropomorphic.</p>

<p class='c003'>Next in order to the Yahvist comes the Second Elohist
(symbolised by the letter <abbr class='spell'>E</abbr>), whose title is derived from the
period, not very far distant, in the history of criticism, when
what is now known as the Priestly Code was assigned to a First
Elohist. The Elohist is characterised by the use of the word
Elohim, ‘God,’ rather than Yahveh, and the critics have
discovered in him a native of the northern kingdom. To him
belong the ‘Ten Words’ which represent the original form of
the Ten Commandments, as well as the history of Joseph.
He is said to have written with a certain theological tendency,
to which is due his predilection for introducing dreams and
angels into his narrative. His date is ascribed to the eighth
century <abbr class='spell'>B.C.</abbr>, and the combination of his narrative with that of
the Yahvist (<abbr class='spell'>J.E.</abbr>) produced a composite work to which the
name of Prophetic or Pre-Deuteronomic Redaction has been
applied. The Redactor endeavoured to reconcile the contradictions
between the two narratives by various harmonistic
expedients; his success was not great, and the nineteenth
century critic accordingly believes himself able not only to
separate the two original documents, but to point out the
additions of the Redactor as well.</p>

<p class='c003'>Contemporaneous with this work of redaction was the
appearance of a new book, the so-called Book of the Covenant.
This was of small dimensions; at any rate, all that remains of it is
contained in a few chapters of Exodus (<abbr title='twenty'>xx.</abbr> 24-<abbr title='twenty-three'>xxiii.</abbr> 33, <abbr title='twenty-four'>xxiv.</abbr> 3-8).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>It was added, however, to the Prophetic Redaction, and the
Mosaic Law for the first time was introduced to the world.</p>

<p class='c003'>But now appeared a book which was of momentous consequences
for both the history and the religion of Judah.
This was the book of Deuteronomy, or rather the middle
portion of the book of Deuteronomy (<abbr title='chapters'>chaps.</abbr> <abbr title='twelve'>xii</abbr>-<abbr title='twenty-six'>xxvi.</abbr>), the rest
of the book being a subsequent addition. This abbreviated
Deuteronomy, it is assumed, is ‘the book of the Law’ which
Hilkiah the high priest declared he had ‘found in the house
of the Lord’ in the reign of Josiah, and it is further assumed
that the word ‘found’ is intended to cover a ‘pious fraud.’ The
Egyptian inscriptions mention books of early date which had
been similarly ‘found’ in the temples, and some of these
books really seem to have been forgeries of a later date.<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c013'><sup>[126]</sup></a>
Modern criticism has determined that Hilkiah and his friends
imitated the example of the Egyptian priests in the case of
Deuteronomy. At all events, the results were instantaneous
and revolutionary. The king and his court believed that they
had before them the actual commands of their God to the
great lawgiver of Israel, and the Jewish religion underwent
accordingly a radical reform. Nor did the effect of the
supposed discovery end here. Like the forged Decretals in
mediæval Europe, the book of Deuteronomy had a continuous
and wide-reaching influence upon Jewish thought. Its
teaching was matured during the Exile, and out of it grew that
form of Jewish religion of which Christianity was the heir.
The book of Deuteronomy (symbolised by <abbr class='spell'>D</abbr>) in the first as
well as in the second or enlarged edition belongs to the latter
part of the seventh century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> But the Hexateuch was still far
from complete. During the Exile a book of the Law, now
contained in <abbr title='Leviticus'>Lev.</abbr> <abbr title='seventeen'>xvii.</abbr>-<abbr title='twenty-six'>xxvi.</abbr>, was written and promulgated, the
author, it appears, having been incited to his work by Ezekiel’s
ideal of a theocratic state. This book of the Law was followed
by a far more ambitious production, the ‘Priestly Code’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>(generally known as <abbr class='spell'>P</abbr>, and not unfrequently called the
‘Grundschrift’ by German writers). The Priestly Code
embodies what earlier critics knew as the work of the First
Elohist; it not only in the name of Moses shapes the ritual
and religion of Israel to the advantage of the priests, but it
attempts to trace the history of the revelation which resulted
in that religion back to the Creation itself. The name of
Elohim is again a distinguishing feature in the narrative, which
is described by the ‘critics’ as formal and pedantic, as
affectedly archaistic, and as disfigured by a strong theological
tendency. Wellhausen and Stade assure us that it transforms
the patriarchs into pious Jews of the Exile. And yet it was
just this narrative, which we are now told bears so plainly on
its face the marks of its late age and sacerdotal character,
that hardly twenty years ago was declared by the critics
themselves to be the oldest portion of the Hexateuch!</p>

<p class='c003'>By this time the Hexateuch was nearly ready to become
the Pentateuch, which should be read by Ezra before the
Jewish community as ‘the law of God’ (<abbr title='Nehemiah'>Nem.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 8), and
be accepted by the hostile Samaritans as alone authoritative
among the sacred books of Israel. All that was needed
further was to combine the existing books into a whole,
smoothing over the inconsistencies between them and supplying
links of connection. The ‘final Redactor’ who accomplished
this task lived shortly after the Exile, and has been
identified with Ezra by some of the critics. Whoever he was,
he was naturally more in harmony with the spirit and ideas of
the Priestly Code than he was with those of the Prophetic
Redaction, or even of Deuteronomy; indeed, it is hard to
understand why he should have troubled himself about the
Prophetic Redaction at all. Between the Jewish religion of
the days of Asa or Jehoshaphat and that of the period after
the Exile a great gulf was fixed.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is clear that if the modern literary analysis of the
Pentateuch is justified, it is useless to look to the five books
of Moses for authentic history. There is nothing in them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>which can be ascribed with certainty to the age of Moses,
nothing which goes back even to the age of the Judges.
Between the Exodus out of Egypt and the composition of the
earliest portion of the so-called Mosaic Law there would have
been a dark and illiterate interval of several centuries. Not
even tradition could be trusted to span them. For the Mosaic
age, and still more for the age before the Exodus, all that we
read in the Old Testament would be historically valueless.</p>

<p class='c003'>Such criticism, therefore, as accepts the results of ‘the
literary analysis’ of the Hexateuch acts consistently in stamping
as mythical the whole period of Hebrew history which
precedes the settlement of the Israelitish tribes in Canaan.
Doubt is thrown even on their residence in Egypt and subsequent
escape from ‘the house of bondage.’ Moses himself
becomes a mere figure of mythland, a hero of popular
imagination whose sepulchre was unknown because it had
never been occupied. In order to discredit the earlier records
of the Israelitish people, there is no need of indicating contradictions—real
or otherwise—in the details of the narratives
contained in them, of enlarging upon their chronological
difficulties, or of pointing to the supernatural elements they
involve; the late dates assigned to the medley of documents
which have been discovered in the Hexateuch are sufficient of
themselves to settle the question.<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c013'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The dates are largely, if not altogether, dependent on the
assumption that Hebrew literature is not older than the age of
David. A few poems like the Song of Deborah may have
been handed down orally from an earlier period, but readers
and writers, it is assumed, there were none. The use of writing
for literary purposes was coeval with the rise of the monarchy.
The oldest inscription in the letters of the Phœnician alphabet
yet discovered is only of the ninth century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>, and the alphabet
would have been employed for monumental purposes long
before it was applied to the manufacture of books. As Wolf’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>theory of the origin and late date of the Homeric Poems
avowedly rested on the belief that the literary use of writing in
Greece was of late date, so too the theory of the analysts of the
Hexateuch rests tacitly on the belief that the Israelites of the
age of Moses and the Judges were wholly illiterate. Moses did
not write the Pentateuch because he could not have done so.</p>

<p class='c003'>The huge edifice of modern Pentateuchal criticism is thus
based on a theory and an assumption. The theory is that of
‘the literary analysis’ of the Hexateuch, the assumption that
a knowledge of writing in Israel was of comparatively late date.
The theory, however, is philological, not historical. The
analysis is philological rather than literary, and depends
entirely on the occurrence and use of certain words and
phrases. Lists have been drawn up of the words and phrases
held to be peculiar to the different writers between whom the
Hexateuch is divided, and the portion of the Hexateuch to be
assigned to each is determined accordingly. That it is sometimes
necessary to cut a verse in two, somewhat to the injury of
the sense, matters but little; the necessities of the theory require
the sacrifice, and the analyst looks no further. Great things grow
out of little, and the mathematical minuteness with which the
Hexateuch is apportioned among its numerous authors, and the
long lists of words and idioms by which the apportionment is
supported, all have their origin in Astruc’s separation of the book
of Genesis into two documents, in one of which the name of
Yahveh is used, while in the other it is replaced by Elohim.<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c013'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>The historian, however, is inclined to look with suspicion
upon historical results which rest upon purely philological
evidence. It is not so very long ago since the comparative
philologists believed they had restored the early history of the
Aryan race. With the help of the dictionary and grammar
they had painted an idyllic picture of the life and culture of
the primitive Aryan family and traced the migrations of its
offshoots from their primeval Asiatic home. But anthropology
has rudely dissipated all these reconstructions of primitive
history, and has not spared even the Aryan family or the
Asiatic home itself. The history that was based on philology
has been banished to fairyland. It may be that the historical
results based on the complicated and ingenious system of
Hexateuchal criticism will hereafter share the same fate.</p>

<p class='c003'>In fact, there is one characteristic of them which cannot but
excite suspicion. A passage which runs counter to the theory
of the critic is at once pronounced an interpolation, due to the
clumsy hand of some later ‘Redactor.’ Thus ‘the tabernacle
of the congregation’ is declared to have been an invention of
the Priestly Code; and therefore a verse in the First Book
of Samuel (<abbr title='two'>ii.</abbr> 22), which happens to refer to it, is arbitrarily
expunged from the text. Similarly passages in the historical
books which imply an acquaintance on the part of Solomon
and his successors with the laws and institutions of the Priestly
Code are asserted to be late additions, and assigned to the
very circle of writers to which the composition of the Code is
credited. Indeed, if we are to believe the analysts, a considerable
part of the professedly historical literature of the Old
Testament was written or ‘redacted’ chiefly with the purpose
of bolstering up the ideas and inventions either of the
Deuteronomist or of the later Code. This is a cheap and easy
way of rewriting ancient history, but it is neither scientific nor in
accordance with the historical method, however consonant it
may be with the methods of the philologist.</p>

<p class='c003'>When, however, we come to examine the philological
evidence upon which we are asked to accept this new reading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>of ancient Hebrew history, we find that it is wofully defective.
We are asked to believe that a European scholar of the nineteenth
century can analyse with mathematical precision a work
composed centuries ago in the East for Eastern readers in a
language that is long since dead, can dissolve it verse by verse,
and even word by word, into its several elements, and fix the
approximate date and relation of each. The accomplishment of
such a feat is an impossibility, and to attempt it is to sin as
much against common sense as against the laws of science.
Science teaches us that we can attain to truth only by the help
of comparison; we can know things scientifically only in so
far as they can be compared and measured one with another.
Where there is no comparison there can be no scientific result.
Even the logicians of the Middle Ages taught that no conclusion
can be drawn from what they termed a single instance.
It is just this, however, that the Hexateuchal critics have
essayed to do. The Pentateuch and its history have been
compared with nothing except themselves, and the results have
been derived not from the method of comparison, but from
the so-called ‘tact’ and arbitrary judgment of the individual
scholar. Certain postulates have been assumed, the consequences
of which have been gradually evolved, one after
another, while the coherence and credibility of the general
hypothesis has been supported by the invention of further
subordinate hypotheses as the need for them arose. The
‘critical’ theory of the origin and character of the Hexateuch
closely resembles the Ptolemaic theory of the universe;
like the latter, it is highly complicated and elaborate, coherent
in itself, and perfect on paper, but unfortunately baseless in
reality.</p>

<p class='c003'>Its very complication condemns it. It is too ingenious to
be true. Had the Hexateuch been pieced together as we are
told it was, it would have required a special revelation to discover
the fact. We may lay it down as a general rule in
science that the more simple a theory is, the more likely it is
to be correct. It is the complicated theories, which demand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>all kinds of subsidiary qualifications and assistant hypotheses,
that are put aside by the progress of science. The wit of man
may be great, but it needs a mass of material before even a
simple theory can be established with any pretence to scientific
value.</p>

<p class='c003'>There is yet another reason why the new theory of the
origin of the Mosaic Law stands self-condemned. It deals with
the writers and readers of the ancient East as if they were
modern German professors and their literary audience. The
author of the Priestly Code is supposed to go to work with
scissors and paste, and with a particular object in view, like a
rather wooden and unimaginative compiler of to-day. And so
closely did the minds and methods of the authors of the
Hexateuch resemble those of their modern European critics,
that in spite of their efforts to conceal the piecemeal nature of
their work, as well as of the fact that it actually deceived their
countrymen to whom it was addressed, to the European
scholar of to-day it all lies open and revealed. When, however,
we turn to other products of Oriental thought, whether
ancient or modern, we do not find that this is the way in
which the authors of them have written history, or what
purports to be history, neither do we find their readers to be
at all like those for whom the Hexateuch is supposed to have
been compiled. The point of view of an Oriental is still
essentially different from that of a European, at all events so
far as history and literature are concerned; and the attempt to
transform the ancient Israelitish historians into somewhat
inferior German compilers proves only a strange want of
familiarity with Eastern modes of thought.</p>

<p class='c003'>But it is not only science, it is common sense as well, which
is violated by the endeavour to foist philological speculations
into the treatment of historical questions. Hebrew is a dead
language; it is moreover a language which is but imperfectly
known. Our knowledge of it is derived entirely from that
fragment of its literature which is preserved in the Old Testament,
and the errors of copyists and the corruptions of the text
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>make a good deal even of this obscure and doubtful. There
are numerous words, the traditional rendering of which is
questionable; there are numerous others in the case of which
it is certainly wrong; and there is passage after passage in
which the translations of scholars vary from one another,
sometimes even to contradiction. Of both grammar and
lexicon it may be said that we see them through a glass
darkly. Not unfrequently the reading of the Septuagint—the
earliest manuscript of which is six hundred years older than
the earliest manuscript of the Hebrew text—differs entirely
from the reading of the Hebrew; and there is a marked tendency
among the Hexateuchal analysts to prefer it, though the
recently-discovered Hebrew text of the book of Ecclesiasticus
seems to show that the preference is not altogether justified.</p>

<p class='c003'>How, then, can a modern Western scholar analyse with even
approximate exactitude an ancient Hebrew work, and on the
strength of the language and style dissolve it once more into
its component atoms? How can he determine the relation of
these atoms one to the other, or presume to fix the dates to
which they severally belong? The task would be impossible
even in the case of a modern English book, although English
is a spoken language with which we are all supposed to be
thoroughly acquainted, while its vast literature is familiar to us
all. And yet even where we know that a work is composite, it
passes the power of man to separate it into its elements and
define the limits of each. No one, for instance, would dream
of attempting such a task in the case of the novels of Besant
and Rice; and the endeavour to distinguish in certain plays of
Shakespeare what belongs to the poet himself and what to
Fletcher has met with the oblivion it deserved. Is it likely
that a problem which cannot be solved in the case of an
English book can be solved where its difficulties are increased
a thousandfold? The minuteness and apparent precision of
Hexateuchal criticism are simply due, like that of the
Ptolemaic theory, to the artificial character of the basis on
which it rests. It is, in fact, a philological mirage; it attempts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>the impossible, and in place of the scientific method of comparison,
it gives us as a starting-point the assumptions and
arbitrary principles of a one-sided critic.<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c013'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Where philology has failed, archæology has come to our help.
The needful comparison of the Old Testament record with
something else than itself has been afforded by the discoveries
which have been made of recent years in Egypt and
Babylonia and other parts of the ancient East. At last we are
able to call in the aid of the scientific method, and test the age
and character, the authenticity and trustworthiness of the Old
Testament history, by monuments about whose historical
authority there can be no question. And the result of the test
has, on the whole, been in favour of tradition, and against the
doctrines of the newer critical school. It has vindicated the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>antiquity and credibility of the narratives of the Pentateuch; it
has proved that the Mosaic age was a highly literary one, and
that consequently the marvel would be, not that Moses should
have written, but that he should not have done so; and it has
undermined the foundation on which the documentary hypothesis
of the origin of the Hexateuch has been built. We are
still indeed only at the beginning of discoveries; those made
during the past year or two have for the student of Genesis
been exceptionally important; but enough has now been
gained to assure us that the historian may safely disregard the
philological theory of Hexateuchal criticism, and treat the books
of the Pentateuch from a wholly different point of view. They
are a historical record, and it is for the historian and archæologist,
and not for the grammarian, to determine their value and age.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>The investigation of the literary sources of history has been
a peculiarly German pastime. Doubtless such an investigation
has been necessary. But it is exposed to the danger of
trying to make bricks without straw. More often than not the
materials are wanting for arriving at conclusions of solid
scientific value. The results announced in such cases are due
partly to the critic’s own prepossessions and postulates, partly
to the imperfection of the evidence. It is easy to doubt, still
easier to deny, especially where the evidence is defective, and
the criticism of the literary sources of a narrative has sometimes
meant an unwarrantable and unintelligent scepticism. To
reverse traditional judgments, to reject external testimony, and
to discover half-a-dozen authors where antiquity knew of but
one, may be a proof of the critic’s ingenuity, but it does not
always demonstrate his appreciation of evidence.</p>

<p class='c003'>Criticism of the literary sources of our historical knowledge
is indeed necessary, and a recognition of the fact has much to
do with the advance which has been made during the present
century in the study of the past. But it must not be forgotten
that such criticism has its weak side. Internal evidence alone
is always unsatisfactory; it offers too much scope for the play
of the critic’s imagination and the impression of his own
idiosyncrasies upon the records of history. It resembles too
much the procedure of the spider who spins his web out of
himself. It is wanting in that element of comparison without
which scientific truth is unattainable. To determine the age
and trustworthiness of our literary authorities is doubtless of
extreme importance to the historian, but unfortunately the
materials for doing so are too often absent, and the fancies
and assumptions of the critic are put in their place.</p>

<p class='c003'>The trustworthiness of an author, like the reality of the facts
he narrates, can be adequately tested in only one way. We
must be able to compare his accounts of past events with
other contemporaneous records of them. Sometimes these
records consist of pottery or other products of human industry
which anthropology is able to interpret; often they are the far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>more important inscriptions which were written or engraved by
the actors in the events themselves. In other words, it is to
archæology that we must look for a verification or the reverse of
the ancient history that has been handed down to us as well as
of the credibility of its narrators. The written monuments of
the ancient East which belong to the same age as the patriarchs
or Moses can alone assure us whether we are to trust the
narrative of the Pentateuch or to see in it a confused medley of
legends the late date of which makes belief in them impossible.</p>

<p class='c003'>As has been said above, Oriental archæology has already
disclosed sufficient to show us to which of these two alternatives
we must lean. On the one hand, much of the history
contained in the book of Genesis has been shown, directly or
indirectly, to be authentic; on the other hand, the new-fangled
theory of the composition of the Hexateuch has been
decisively ruled out of court. Let us take the second point
first.</p>

<p class='c003'>In 1887 a large collection of clay tablets inscribed with
cuneiform characters was found by the Egyptian fellahin
among the ruins of the ancient city now known as Tel el-Amarna,
on the eastern bank of the Nile, about midway
between Minieh and Siût. The city had enjoyed but a brief
existence. Towards the close of the eighteenth dynasty, the
Pharaoh, Amenophis <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>, had died, leaving the throne to his son,
Amenophis <abbr title='the fourth'><span class='fss'>IV.</span></abbr>, a mere lad, who was still under the influence of
his mother Teie. Teie was of Asiatic extraction, and fanatically
devoted to an Asiatic form of faith. This devotion was shared
by her son, and soon began to bear fruit. Amon of Thebes had
to make way for a new deity, who was worshipped under the
visible form of the solar disk, and the old religion of Egypt of
which the Pharaoh was the official head was utterly proscribed.
It was not long before the Pharaoh and the powerful hierarchy
of Thebes were at open war; the very name of Amon was
erased from the monuments where it occurred, and the king
changed his own name to that of Khu-n-Aten, ‘the glory of
the Solar Disk.’ But in the end, Khu-n-Aten had to quit the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>capital of his fathers and establish himself with his adherents
and courtiers in a new city further north. This city, Khut-Aten,
as. it was called, is now represented by the mounds of
Tel el-Amarna.</p>

<p class='c003'>Here the Pharaoh was surrounded by his followers, a large
proportion of whom were Asiatics, chiefly from Canaan. The
court of Egypt, as well as its religion, became Asiatised. The
revolution in religion was also accompanied by a revolution
in art. The old hieratic canon of Egyptian art was cast aside,
and an excessive realism was aimed at, sometimes even to the
verge of caricature. In the centre of the new city a temple
was raised to the new divinity of Egypt, and hard by the
temple rose the palace of the king. Its ornamentation was
surpassingly gorgeous. Its walls and columns were inlaid with
precious stones, with coloured glass and gold; even its floors
were painted with scenes from nature which are of the highest
artistic excellence, and statues were erected, some of which
remind us of the best work of classical Greece.<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c013'><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>But the glory of Khut-Aten was short-lived. The latter
years of the reign of its founder were clouded with religious
and civil dissension. Religious persecution at home had been
followed by trouble and revolt abroad in the Asiatic provinces
of the Empire. When Khu-n-Aten died, his enemies were
already pressing around him, and the perils that threatened
him in Egypt obliged him to return no answer to the despairing
appeals for help that came to him from his governors in
Palestine. Hardly had the mummy of the king been deposited
in the superb tomb that he had carved out of a mountain
amid the desolation and solitude of a distant gorge, when the
spoiler was at hand. The royal sarcophagus never reached
the niche in which it was intended to be placed; the enemies
of the ‘Heretic King’ hacked to pieces its granite sides as it
lay upon the floor of the inner chamber, and scattered to the
winds the remains of its occupant. The destruction of Khut-Aten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>soon followed; one or two princes of the family of
Khu-n-Aten did indeed struggle for a brief while to maintain
themselves upon his throne, but before long Amon triumphed
over the Solar Disk. The great temple of Aten was razed to
the ground, and its stones carried away to serve as materials
for the sanctuaries of the victorious god of Thebes. The
palace of Khu-n-Aten was destroyed, the religion he had
essayed to force upon his subjects was forgotten, and the
Asiatic officials who had filled his court were driven into exile.
The city he had built was deserted, never to be inhabited
again.</p>

<p class='c003'>The clay tablets found by the fellahin were discovered on
the site of the Foreign Office of the ‘Heretic King,’ the bricks
of which were each stamped with the words ‘The Record Office
of Aten-Ra.’<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c013'><sup>[131]</sup></a> It adjoined the palace, and we learn from a
clay seal found among its ruins by Professor Petrie that it was
under the control of a Babylonian. This, however, was not
extraordinary, since the foreign correspondence of the Pharaoh
was carried on in the Babylonian language and the Babylonian
system of writing. In fact, the Tel el-Amarna tablets have
shown that the Western Asia conquered by the Egyptian kings
of the eighteenth dynasty was wholly under the domination
of Babylonian culture. All over the civilised Oriental world,
from the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates to those of the
Nile, the common medium of literary and diplomatic intercourse
was the language and script of Chaldæa. Not only the
writing material, but all that was written upon it, was borrowed
from Babylonia. So powerful was this Babylonian influence,
that the Egyptians themselves were compelled to submit to it.
In place of their own singular and less cumbrous hieratic or
cursive script, they had to communicate with their Asiatic
subjects and allies in the cuneiform characters and the Babylonian
tongue. Indeed, there is evidence that the memoranda
made by the official scribes of the Pharaoh’s court, at all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>events in Palestine, were compiled in the same foreign speech
and syllabary.<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c013'><sup>[132]</sup></a> That the Babylonian language and script
were studied in Egypt itself we know from the evidence of the
Tel el-Amarna tablets. Among them have been found fragments
of dictionaries as well as Babylonian mythological tales.
In one of the latter certain of the words and phrases are
separated from one another in order to assist the learner.</p>

<p class='c003'>The use of the Babylonian language and system of writing
in Western Asia must have been of considerable antiquity.
This is proved by the fact that the characters had gradually
assumed peculiar forms in the different countries in which
they were employed, so that by merely glancing at the form
of the writing we can tell whether a tablet was written in
Palestine or in Northern Syria, in Cappadocia or Mesopotamia.
The knowledge of them, moreover, was not confined to the
few. On the contrary, education must have been widely
spread; the Tel el-Amarna correspondence was carried on,
not only by professional scribes, but also by officials, by
soldiers, and by merchants. Even women appear among
the writers, and take part in the politics of the day. The
letters, too, are sometimes written about the most trivial
matters, and not unfrequently enter into the most unimportant
details.</p>

<p class='c003'>They were sent from all parts of the known civilised world.
The kings of Babylonia and Assyria, of Mesopotamia and
Cappadocia, the Egyptian governors of Syria and Canaan,
even the chiefs of the Bedâwin tribes on the Egyptian frontier,
who were subsidised by the Pharaoh’s government like the
Afghan chiefs of to-day, all alike contributed to the correspondence.
Letters, in fact, must have been constantly passing
to and fro along the high-roads which intersected Western
Asia. From one end of it to the other the population was in
perpetual literary intercourse, proving that the Oriental world
in the century before the Exodus was as highly educated and
literary as was Europe in the age of the Renaissance. Nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>was all this literary activity and intercourse a new thing.
Several of the letters had been sent to Amenophis <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>, the
father of the ‘Heretic King,’ and had been removed by the
latter from the archives of Thebes when he transferred his
residence to his new capital. And the literary intercourse
which was carried on in the time of Amenophis <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> was merely
a continuation of that which had been carried on for centuries
previously. The culture of Babylonia, like that of Egypt,
was essentially literary, and this culture had been spread
over Western Asia from a remote date. The letters of
Khammu-rabi or Amraphel to his vassal, the king of Larsa,
have just been recovered, and among the multitudinous
contract-tablets of the same epoch are specimens of commercial
correspondence.</p>

<p class='c003'>We have, however, only to consider for a moment what was
meant by learning the language and script of Babylonia in
order to realise what a highly-organised system of education
must have prevailed throughout the whole civilised world of
the day. Not only had the Babylonian language to be acquired,
but some knowledge also of the older agglutinative language
of Chaldæa was also needed in order to understand the system
of writing. It was as if the schoolboy of to-day had to add
a knowledge of Greek to a knowledge of French. And the
system of writing itself involved years of hard and patient
study. It consisted of a syllabary containing hundreds of
characters, each of which had not only several different
phonetic values, but several different ideographic significations
as well. Nor was this all. A group of characters might be
used ideographically to express a word the pronunciation of
which had nothing to do with the sounds of the individual
characters of which it was composed. The number of ideographs
which had to be learned was thus increased fivefold.
And, unlike the hieroglyphs of Egypt, the forms of these
ideographs gave no assistance to the memory. They had long
since lost all resemblance to the pictures out of which they
had originally been developed, and consisted simply of various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>combinations of wedges or lines. It was difficult enough for
the Babylonian or Assyrian to learn the syllabary; for a
foreigner the task was almost herculean.</p>

<p class='c003'>That it should have been undertaken implies the existence
of libraries and schools. One of the distinguishing features
of Babylonian culture were the libraries which existed in the
great towns, and wherever Babylonian culture was carried this
feature of it must have gone too. Hence in the libraries of
Western Asia clay books inscribed with cuneiform characters
must have been stored up, while beside them must have been
the schools, where the pupils bent over their exercises and the
teachers instructed them in the language and script of the
foreigner. The world into which Moses was born was a world
as literary as our own.</p>

<p class='c003'>If Western Asia were the home of a long-established literary
culture, Egypt was even more so. From time immemorial
the land of the Pharaohs had been a land of writers and
readers. At a very early period the hieroglyphic system of
writing had been modified into a cursive hand, the so-called
hieratic; and as far back as the days of the third and fifth
dynasties famous books had been written, and the author of
one of them, Ptah-hotep, already deplores the degeneracy and
literary decay of his own time. The traveller up the Nile, who
examines the cliffs that line the river, cannot but be struck by
the multitudinous names that are scratched upon them. He
is at times inclined to believe that every Egyptian in ancient
times knew how to write, and had little else to do than to
scribble a record of himself on the rocks. The impression
is the same that we derive from the small objects which are
disinterred in such thousands from the sites of the old cities.
Wherever it is possible, an inscription has been put upon
them, which, it seems taken for granted, could be read by
all. Even the walls of the temples and tombs were covered
with written texts; wherever the Egyptian turned, or whatever
might be the object he used, it was difficult for him to avoid
the sight of the written word. Whoever was born in the land
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>of Egypt was perforce familiarised with the art of writing from
the very days of his infancy.</p>

<p class='c003'>Evidence is accumulating that the same literary culture
which thus prevailed in Egypt and Western Asia had extended
also to the peninsula of Arabia. Dr. Glaser and Professor
Hommel, two of the foremost authorities on the subject,
believe that some of the inscriptions of Southern Arabia go
back to the age of the eighteenth and nineteenth Egyptian
dynasties; and if they are right, as they seem to be, in
holding that the kingdom of Ma’n or the Minæans preceded
that of Saba or Sheba, the antiquity of writing in Arabia
must be great.<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c013'><sup>[133]</sup></a> The fact that the Babylonian dynasty to
which Amraphel belonged was of South Arabian origin supports
the belief in the existence of Arabian culture at an
early period, as do also the latest researches into the source
of the so-called Phœnician alphabet. We now know that
in the Mosaic age it was the cuneiform syllabary, and not
the Phœnician alphabet, that was used in Canaan, while
the oldest inscription in Phœnician letters yet found is later
than the reign of Solomon. On the other hand, the South
Arabian form of the alphabet contains letters which denote
sounds once possessed by all the Semitic languages, but
lost by the language of Canaan; and though some of these
letters may be derived from other letters of the alphabet, there
are some which have an independent origin. The caravan-road
along which the spices of the South were carried to
Syria and Egypt passed through the territory of Edom;
inscriptions of the kings of Ma’n have already been discovered
near Teima, not far from the frontiers of Midian; and it may
be that we shall yet find records among the ranges of Mount
Seir which will form a link between the early texts of Southern
Arabia and the oldest text that has come from Phœnician
soil.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Exodus from Egypt, then, took place during a highly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>literary period, and the people who took part in it passed
from a country where the art of writing literally stared them in
the face to another country which had been the centre of the
Tel el-Amarna correspondence and the home of Babylonian
literary culture for unnumbered centuries. Is it conceivable
that their leader and reputed lawgiver should not have been
able to write, that he should not have been educated ‘in the
wisdom of Egypt,’ or that the upper classes of his nation
should not have been able to read? Let it be granted that
the Israelites were but a Bedâwin tribe which had been reduced
by the Pharaohs to the condition of public slaves;
still, they necessarily had leaders and overseers among them,
who, according to the State regulations of Egypt, were responsible
to the Government for the rest of their countrymen, and
some at least of these leaders and overseers would have been
educated men. Moses could have written the Pentateuch,
even if he did not do so.</p>

<p class='c003'>Moreover, the clay tablets on which the past history of
Canaan could be read were preserved in the libraries and
archive-chambers of the Canaanitish cities down to the time
when the latter were destroyed. If any doubt had existed on
the subject after the revelations of the Tel el-Amarna tablets,
it has been set at rest by the discovery of a similar tablet on
the site of Lachish. In some cases the cities were not
destroyed, so far as we know, until the period when it is
allowed that the Israelites had ceased to be illiterate. Gezer,
for example, which plays a leading part in the Tel el-Amarna
correspondence, does not seem to have fallen into the hands
of an enemy until it was captured by the Egyptian Pharaoh
and handed over to his son-in-law Solomon. As long as a
knowledge of the cuneiform script continued, the early records
of Canaan were thus accessible to the historian, many of
them being contemporaneous with the events to which they
referred.</p>

<p class='c003'>A single archæological discovery has thus destroyed the
base of operations from which a one-sided criticism of Old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Testament history had started. The really strong point in
favour of it was the assumption that the Mosaic age was
illiterate. Just as Wolf founded his criticism and analysis of
the Homeric Hymns on the belief that the use of writing for
literary purposes was of late date in Greece, so the belief that
the Israelites of the time of Moses could not read or write
was the ultimate foundation on which the modern theory of
the composition of the Hexateuch has been based. Whether
avowed or not, it was the true starting-point of critical scepticism,
the one solid foundation on which it seemed to rest.
The destruction of the foundation endangers the structure
which has been built upon it.</p>

<p class='c003'>In fact, it wholly alters the position of the modern critical
theory. The <i>onus probandi</i> no longer lies on the shoulders
of the defenders of traditional views. Instead of being called
upon to prove that Moses could have written a book, it is
they who have to call on the disciples of the modern theory
to show reason why he should not have done so. And it is
always difficult to prove a negative.</p>

<p class='c003'>It may be said that the positive arguments of the modern
hypothesis remain as they were. That is possible, but their background
is gone. And how conscious the Hexateuchal analysts
were of the importance of this background, before the discovery
of the Tel el-Amarna tablets, may be seen from their desperate
efforts to rid themselves of the counter evidence afforded by
the Song of Deborah. ‘Out of Machir,’ it is there said
(<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v.</abbr> 14), ‘came down lawgivers, and out of Zebulun
they that handle the stylus of the scribe.’ In defiance of
philology, the latter words were translated ‘the baton of the
marshal’! But <span lang="hbo"><i>sopher</i></span> is ‘scribe’ here, as elsewhere in
Hebrew; and his <i>shebhet</i>, or ‘stylus,’ is often depicted on the
Egyptian monuments. In the Blessing of Jacob, which is
allowed to be of early date, like the Song of Deborah, the
<i>shebhet</i> is associated with the <i>m’khoqêq</i> or ‘lawgiver’ (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr>
<abbr title='forty-nine'>xlix.</abbr> 10). The word <i>m’khoqêq</i>, however, meant literally an
‘engraver,’ one who did not write his laws on papyrus or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>parchment, as the scribe would have done, but caused them
to be engraved on stone, or metal, or clay.<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c013'><sup>[134]</sup></a> In either case
they were written down; and written documents are thus
implied not only in the expression ‘the stylus of the scribe,’
but in the word ‘lawgiver’ as well. The Song of Deborah,
by general consent, belongs to the oldest period of the Hebrew
settlement in Palestine; it belongs also to an age of anarchy
and national depression; and, nevertheless, it is already acquainted
with Israelitish lawgivers and scribes, with engravers
of the laws and handlers of the pen. It is little wonder that
its evidence was explained away in accordance with a method
which is neither scientific nor historical.</p>

<p class='c003'>As historians, we are bound to admit the antiquity of writing
in Israel. The scribe goes back to the Mosaic age, like the
lawgiver, and in this respect, therefore, the Israelites formed
no exception to the nations among whom they lived. They
were no islet of illiterate barbarism in the midst of a great
sea of literary culture and activity, nor were they obstinately
asleep while all about them were writing and reading.</p>

<p class='c003'>But even the analysis of the Hexateuchal critics fails to
stand the test of archæological discovery. Nowhere does
there seem to be clearer evidence of the documentary hypothesis
than in the story of the Deluge. Here the combination
of a Yahvistic and an Elohistic narrative seems to force itself
upon the attention of the reader, and the advocates of the
disintegration theory have triumphantly pointed to the internal
contradictions and inconsistencies of the story in support of
their views. If anywhere, here, at any rate, the external
testimony of archæeology ought to be given on the side of
modern criticism.</p>

<p class='c003'>And yet it is not. It so happens that among the fragments
of ancient Babylonian epic and legend which have come down
to us is a long poem in twelve books, composed in the age of
Abraham, or earlier, by a certain Sin-liqi-unnini, and recounting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>the adventures of the Chaldæan hero Gilgames. It is based
on older materials, and is, in fact, the last note and final
summing-up of Chaldæan epic song. Older poems have been
incorporated into it, and the epic itself has been artificially
moulded upon an astronomical plan. Its twelve books, in
each of which a new adventure of its hero is recorded, correspond
with the twelve signs of the zodiac, and the months of
the year that were named after them. The eleventh month
was presided over by Aquarius, and was the month of ‘the
Curse of Rain’; into the eleventh book of the poem, accordingly,
there has been introduced the episode of the Deluge.</p>

<p class='c003'>The story of the Deluge had been the subject of many
poems. Fragments of some of them we possess, and the
details of the story were not always the same. But the version
preserved in the epic of Gilgames became what we may term
the standard one; the very fact that it was embodied in the
most famous of the epics made it widely known. When it
was discovered by Mr. George Smith in 1872, its striking
resemblance to the story of the Flood in Genesis was at once
apparent to every one. In details as well as in general outline
the two accounts agreed; even in the moral cause assigned to
the Deluge—the sin of man—the Babylonian story alone among
traditions of a Deluge was at one with the Biblical narrative.</p>

<p class='c003'>A comparison of the Chaldæan and Biblical accounts leads
to the following results. The resemblances between them
extend equally to the Elohistic and the Yahvistic portions of
the Hebrew narrative. Like the Elohist, the epic ascribes the
Deluge to the sins of mankind, and the preservation of
Xisuthros, the Chaldæan Noah, and his family to the piety of
the hero; all living things, moreover, are involved in the
calamity, except such as are preserved in the ark; its approach
is revealed to Xisuthros by the god Ea, who instructs him
how to build ‘the ship’; Ea also, like Elohim, prescribes the
dimensions of the ark, which is divided into rooms and stories,
and pitched within and without; ‘the seed of life of all
kinds’ is taken into it, together with the family of Xisuthros;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>the waters of the Flood are said to cover ‘all the high mountains,’
and to destroy all living creatures except those that
were in the ark; this latter, too, had a window; and when the
Deluge had subsided and Xisuthros had offered a sacrifice on
the peak of the mountain, Bel blessed him and declared that
he would never again destroy the world by a flood while Istar
‘lifted up’ the rainbow, which an old Babylonian hymn calls
‘the bow of the Deluge.’<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c013'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Like the Yahvist, on the other hand, the Babylonian poet
sees in the Flood a punishment for sin, and makes it destroy
all living things except those that were in the ark. He also
states that Xisuthros sent forth three birds, one after the
other, in order to discover whether the waters were subsiding,
two of them being a dove and a raven, and that while the
dove turned back to the ark, the raven flew away. After
the descent from the ark, moreover, Xisuthros, we are told,
built an altar and offered sacrifice on the summit of the
mountain whereon it had rested, and there ‘the gods smelled
the sweet savour’ of the offering. In certain cases the epic
even explains what is doubtful or obscure in the Hebrew text.
Thus it shows that in the account of the sending forth of the
birds one of the birds has been omitted; and that consequently,
in order to complete the number of times the birds were
despatched from the ark, the dove is sent forth twice, while
the raven, instead of being the last to leave the ark, has been
made the first to do so. In the Babylonian story the order is
natural. First, the dove flies forth, then the swallow or ‘bird
of destiny,’ and lastly the raven who feeds on the corpses that
float upon the water, and accordingly does not return. But
the ‘bird of destiny’ carried with it heathen and mythological
associations. It has therefore been omitted by the Biblical
writer, the result being to throw the narrative into confusion.<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c013'><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>The Babylonian origin of the Flood, again, alone explains
the statement that it was partly caused by ‘the fountains of
the great deep’ being broken up. The ‘great deep,’ called
Tiamat in Babylonian mythology, had been placed under
guard at the Creation, according to Chaldæan belief, and so
prevented from gushing forth and destroying mankind. The
whole conception takes us back to the alluvial plain of
Babylonia, liable at any time to be inundated by the waters
of the Persian Gulf, and is wholly inapplicable to a mountainous
country like Palestine, where rain only could have
produced a flood.<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c013'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>There are even indications that in the Biblical narrative
the mythological ideas and polytheistic phraseology of the
Babylonian story have been intentionally contradicted or suppressed.
Thus, not only is the whole colouring of the narrative
sternly monotheistic, but God Himself is made to reveal the
approach of the Deluge to Noah, in contrast with the Babylonian
version, according to which the god Ea announced the
coming catastrophe to the Chaldæan Noah without the knowledge
of the supreme god Bel. And when the Flood was
past, Bel was enraged that any should have escaped living
from it, and the other deities had to intercede before he could
be pacified. So, too, whereas the Babylonian poet tells us
that the Chaldæan Noah closed the door of his ship, in the
book of Genesis it is Yahveh Himself who does so. In the
view of the Biblical writer, nothing was to be allowed to lessen
the omnipotence of the God of Israel.</p>

<p class='c003'>It will be noticed that the coincidences between the Babylonian
and Hebrew narratives are quite as much in details as
in general outlines, and these coincidences cover the Hebrew
narrative as a whole. It is not with the Elohist or with the
Yahvist alone that the Babylonian poet agrees, but with
the supposed combination of their two documents as we now
find it in the book of Genesis. If the documentary hypothesis
were right, there would be only two ways of accounting for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>this fact. Either the Babylonian poet had before him the
present ‘redacted’ text of Genesis, or else the Elohist and
Yahvist must have copied the Babylonian story upon the
mutual understanding that the one should insert what the
other omitted. There is no third alternative.</p>

<p class='c003'>As the Babylonian epic was composed in the age of
Khammu-rabi or Amraphel, neither of the two alternatives is
likely to be accepted by the advocates of the Hexateuchal
theory, and the whole theory, consequently, must be ruled
out of court. It breaks down in the first test case to which
the results of archæological discovery can be applied, a case,
moreover, in which its plausibility is unusually great. Henceforth
the historian who pursues a scientific method may safely
disregard the whole fabric of Hexateuchal criticism.</p>

<p class='c003'>The story of the Deluge itself suggests what may be put in
place of it. With all its likeness to the Babylonian story, the
Biblical narrative has nevertheless undergone a change. It
has been clothed not only in a Hebrew, but also in a Palestinian
dress. The ship of the Chaldæan Noah has become an ark,
as was natural in a country where there were no great rivers or
Persian Gulf; the period of the rainfall has been transferred
from Sebet or January and February, when the winter rains
fall in Babylonia, to ‘the second month’ of the Hebrew civil
year, our October and November, the time of the autumn or
‘former rains’ in Canaan, while the subsidence of the waters
is made to begin in the middle of ‘the seventh month,’ when
the ‘latter rains’ of the Canaanitish spring are over; and the
dove is said to have brought back in its mouth a leaf of the
olive, a tree characteristic of the soil of Palestine. Though
the Biblical narrative has been borrowed from Babylonia, it
has been modified and coloured in the West. Even the hero
of the Babylonian poem has become the Noah or Naham of
Canaan.</p>

<p class='c003'>We have learned from the Tel el-Amarna tablets how this
could have come about. There was one period, and, so far
as we know, one period only, in the history of Western Asia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>when the literature of Babylonia was taught and studied there,
and when the literary ideas and stories of Chaldæa were made
familiar to the people of Canaan. This was the period of
Babylonian influence which ended with the Mosaic age.
With the Hittite conquests of the fourteenth century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>, and
the Israelitish invasion of Canaan, it all came to an end. The
Babylonian story of the Deluge, adapted to Palestine as we
find it in the Pentateuch, must belong to a pre-Mosaic epoch.
And it is difficult to believe that the identity of the details in
the Babylonian and Biblical versions could have remained so
perfect, or that the Biblical writer could have exhibited such
deliberate intention of controverting the polytheistic features
of the original, if he had not still possessed a knowledge of the
cuneiform script. It is difficult to believe that he belonged to
an age when the Phœnician alphabet had taken the place of
the syllabary of Babylonia, and the older literature of Canaan
had become a sealed book.</p>

<p class='c003'>But if so, a new light is shed on the sources of the historical
narratives contained in the Pentateuch. Some of them at
least have come down from the period when the literary
culture of Babylonia was still dominant on the shores of the
Mediterranean. So far from being popular traditions and
myths first committed to writing after the disruption of
Solomon’s kingdom, and amalgamated into their present form
by a series of ‘redactors,’ they will have been derived from
the pre-Mosaic literature of Palestine. Such of them as are
Babylonian in origin will have made their way westwards like
the Chaldæan legends found among the tablets of Tel el-Amarna,
while others will be contemporaneous records of the
events they describe. We must expect to discover in the
Pentateuch not only Israelitish records, but Babylonian,
Canaanitish, Egyptian, even Edomite records as well.</p>

<p class='c003'>The progress of archæological research has already in part
fulfilled this expectation. ‘Ur of the Chaldees’ has been found
at Muqayyar, and the contracts of early Babylonia have shown
that Amorites—or, as we should call them, Canaanites—were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>settled there, and have even brought to light such distinctively
Hebrew names as Jacob-el, Joseph-el, and Ishmael.<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c013'><sup>[138]</sup></a> Even
the name of Abram, Abi-ramu, appears as the father of an
‘Amorite’ witness to a contract in the third generation before
Amraphel. And Amraphel himself, along with his contemporaries,
Chedor-laomer or Kudur-Laghghamar of Elam,
Arioch of Larsa, and Tid’al or Tudghula, has been restored to
the history to which he and his associates had been denied a
claim. The ‘nations’ over whom Tid’al ruled have been
explained, and the accuracy of the political situation described
in the fourteenth chapter of Genesis has been fully vindicated.
Jerusalem, instead of being a name first given to the future
capital of Judah after its capture by David, is proved to have
been its earliest title; and the priest-king Melchizedek finds a
parallel in his later successor, the priest-king Ebed-Tob, who,
in the Tel el-Amarna letters, declares that he had received
his royal dignity, not from his father or his mother, but through
the arm of ‘the mighty king.’ If we turn to Egypt, the archæological
evidence is the same. The history of Joseph displays
an intimate acquaintance on the part of its writer with Egyptian
life and manners in the era of the Hyksos, and offers the only
explanation yet forthcoming of the revolution that took place in
the tenure of land during the Hyksos domination. As we have
seen, there are features in the story which suggest that it has
been translated from a hieratic papyrus. As for the Exodus, we
shall see presently that its geography is that of the nineteenth
dynasty, and of no other period in the history of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c003'>Thus, then, directly or indirectly, much of the history contained
in the Pentateuch has been shown by archæology to be
authentic. And it must be remembered that Oriental archæology
is still in its infancy. Few only of the sites of ancient civilisation
have as yet been excavated, and there are thousands of
cuneiform texts in the Museums of Europe and America which
have not as yet been deciphered. It was only in 1887 that
the Tel el-Amarna tablets, which have had such momentous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>consequences for Biblical criticism, were found, and the disclosures
made by the early contracts of Babylonia, even the
name of Chedor-laomer itself, are of still more recent discovery.
It is therefore remarkable that so much is already in our hands
which confirms the antiquity and historical genuineness of the
Pentateuchal narratives; and it raises the presumption that
with the advance of our knowledge will come further confirmations
of the Biblical story. At any rate, the historian’s path is
clear; the Pentateuch has been tested by the comparative
method of science, and has stood the test. It contains
history, and must be dealt with accordingly like other historical
works. The philological theory with its hair-splitting distinctions,
its Priestly Code and ‘redactors,’ must be put aside,
along with all the historical consequences which it involves.</p>

<p class='c003'>But it does not follow that because the philological theory
is untenable, all inquiries into the character and sources of the
Pentateuch are waste of time. The philological theory has
failed because it has attempted to build up a vast superstructure
on very imperfect and questionable materials; because, in
short, it has attempted to attain historical results without the
use of the historical method. But no one can study the
Pentateuch in the light of other ancient works of a similar
kind without perceiving that it is a compilation, and that its
author—or authors—has made use of a large variety of older
materials. Modern Oriental history has been written in the
same manner; a book, for instance, like the Egyptian history
of El-Maqrîzî, though the production of a single mind, nevertheless
embodies older materials which have been collected
from every side. The Egyptian Book of the Dead, or the
Chaldæan Epic of Gilgames, bears the same testimony. The
growth of the Book of the Dead, the ritual which was needed
by the souls of the Egyptian dead in their passage to the
next world, can actually be traced.<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c013'><sup>[139]</sup></a> It included and combined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>the doctrines of more than one school of early Egyptian
theological thought, and in later days was extensively interpolated
and modernised. Not only were glosses, once intended
to explain the obscurities of the archaic phraseology,
incorporated into the text, but even whole chapters were added
to the work. The Epic of Gilgames similarly embodies other
poems or portions of poems, of which the Episode of the
Deluge is an example. Yet no Assyriologist would dispute
for a moment that from beginning to end it is the work of one
author.</p>

<p class='c003'>Archæology has already shown us that we are right in
believing that the Pentateuch also has been compiled out of
earlier materials. The story of the campaign of Chedor-laomer
must have been derived from a cuneiform tablet; the story of
Joseph seems to have been taken from a hieratic papyrus.
The account of the Deluge has made its way from Babylonia
to Canaan in the days when the culture of Chaldæa extended
to the Mediterranean. We thus have narratives which
presuppose an acquaintance not only with Babylon and Egypt,
but also with Babylonian and Egyptian documents.</p>

<p class='c003'>So, too, the list of Edomite kings contained in the thirty-sixth
chapter of Genesis must have been extracted from the
official annals of Edom. It is a proof that such annals existed,
that the Edomites, like the rest of their neighbours, were
acquainted with the art of writing, and that their official
records were accessible to a Hebrew scribe.</p>

<p class='c003'>We cannot doubt the authenticity of the list, even though
the ancient territory of Edom has not yet been explored, and
no Edomite inscriptions consequently have as yet been found
to verify it. The list, therefore, does not yet stand in the
same fortunate position as the account of Chedor-laomer and
his allies, which has been verified by archæological discovery.
Here even the names of the foreign kings have been preserved
in the Hebrew text with marvellously little corruption. The
whole account must have come from a cuneiform document
coeval with the event it narrates. That is to say, we can here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>trace one of the Pentateuchal narratives not only to a written
source, but to a written source which is at the same time a
contemporaneous record.</p>

<p class='c003'>We may conclude, then, that the Pentateuch has been compiled
from older documents—some Babylonian, some Egyptian,
some Edomite; others, as we may gather from the nature of
their contents, Canaanite and Aramæan—and that many of
these documents belong to the periods to which they refer.
This, however, is not all. In certain cases we can approximately
fix the latest date at which they could have been employed
and combined in the form in which we now find them.
Thus in the geographical chart of Genesis (<abbr title='ten'>x.</abbr> 6), Canaan is
made the brother of Cush and Mizraim. This takes us back
to the time when Canaan was a province of the Egyptian
empire; when that empire came to an end the description
ceased to be possible. After the epoch of the nineteenth
dynasty and the Hebrew Exodus, Canaan and Egypt were cut
off from one another geographically and politically, and
Canaan could never again have been called in Semitic idiom the
brother of Mizraim. It became instead the brother of Aram
and Assur.</p>

<p class='c003'>Here, therefore, the limit of age prescribed by archæology
forbids us to pass beyond the Mosaic epoch. Moses, in short,
is the compiler to whom the archæological evidence indicates
that the tenth chapter of Genesis goes back in its original
shape. But by the side of this evidence there is other evidence
also which tells a different tale. Gomer, or the Kimmerians,
as well as Madai, are named among the sons of Japhet, and
the Assyrian monuments assure us that neither the one nor
the other came within the geographical horizon of Western
Asia before the ninth century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> It was in the ninth century
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> that the Assyrian kings first became acquainted with the
Medes, while the Gimirrâ or Kimmerians did not descend
upon Asia from their seats on the Sea of Azof until about <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>
680. The same reasoning which gives us the Mosaic age as
that of the geographical chart of Genesis in its primitive shape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>gives us the seventh century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> or later for the date of another
portion of the same chapter.</p>

<p class='c003'>The list of the kings of Edom, again, is introduced by
the remark that ‘these are the kings that reigned in the land
of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of
Israel.’ It was not inserted in the book of Genesis, therefore,
until after the age of Saul, a conclusion which is supported by
the fact that the first king named seems to be Balaam, the son
of Beor, who was a contemporary of Moses. If, accordingly,
the Pentateuch was originally compiled in the Mosaic age, it
must have undergone the fate of the Egyptian Book of the
Dead, and been enlarged by subsequent additions. Insertions
and interpolations must have found their way into it as new
editions of it were made.</p>

<p class='c003'>That such was the case there is indirect testimony. On the
one hand the text of the prophetical books was treated in a
similar manner, additions and modifications being made in it
from time to time by the prophet or his successors in order
to adapt it to new political or religious circumstances. Isaiah,
for instance, has copied a prophecy directed by one of his
predecessors against Moab; and after breaking it off in the
middle of a sentence, has adapted it to the needs and circumstances
of his own time. On the other hand, a long-established
Jewish tradition, which has found its way into the Second
Book of Esdras (<abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 21-26), makes Ezra rewrite or edit the
books of Moses. There is no reason to question the substantial
truth of the tradition; Ezra was the restorer of the old
paths, and the Pentateuch may well have taken its present
shape from him. If so, we need not be surprised if we find
here and there in it echoes of the Babylonish captivity.</p>

<p class='c003'>Side by side with materials derived from written sources, the
book of Genesis contains narratives which, at all events in the
first instance, must have resembled the traditions and poems
orally recited in Arab lands, and commemorating the heroes
and forefathers of the tribe. Thus there are two Abrahams;
the one an Abraham who has been born in one of the centres
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>of Babylonian civilisation, who is the ally of Amorite chieftains,
whose armed followers overthrow the rearguard of the
Elamite army, and whom the Hittites of Hebron address as
‘a mighty prince’; the other is an Abraham of the Bedâwin
camp-fire, a nomad whose habits are those of the rude independence
of the desert, whose wife kneads the bread while he
himself kills the calf with which his guests are entertained.
It is true that in actual Oriental life the simplicity of the desert
and the wealth and culture of the town may be found combined
in the same person; that in modern Egypt Arab shêkhs
may still be met with who thus live like wild Bedâwin during
one part of the year, and as rich and civilised townsmen
during another part of it; while in the last century a considerable
portion of Upper Egypt was governed by Bedâwin emirs,
who realised in their own persons that curious duality of life
and manners which to us Westerns appears so strange. But
it is also true that the spirit and tone of the narratives in
Genesis differ along with the character ascribed in them to the
patriarch: we find in them not only the difference between the
guest of the Egyptian Pharaoh and the entertainer of the angels,
but also a difference in the point of view. The one speaks to
us of literary culture, the other of the simple circle of wandering
shepherds to whose limited experience the story-teller has
to appeal. The story may be founded on fact; it may be
substantially true; but it has been coloured by the surroundings
in which it has grown up, and archæological proof of its
historical character can never be forthcoming. At most, it
can be shown to be true to the time and place in which its
scene is laid, and so contains nothing which is inconsistent
with known facts.</p>

<p class='c003'>Such, then, are the main results of the application of the
archæological test to the books of the Pentateuch. The
philological theory, with its minute and mathematically exact
analysis, is brushed aside; it is as little in harmony with
archæology as it is with common sense. The Pentateuch
substantially belongs to the Mosaic age, and may therefore be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>accepted as, in the bulk, the work of Moses himself. But it
is a composite work, embodying materials of various kinds.
Some of these are written documents, descriptive of contemporaneous
events, or recording the cosmological beliefs of
ancient Babylonia; others have been derived from the
unwritten traditions of nomad tribes. The work has passed
through many editions; it is full of interpolations, lengthy and
otherwise; and it has probably received its final shape at the
hands of Ezra. But in order to discover the interpolations,
or to determine the written documents that have been used,
we must have recourse to the historical method and the facts
of archæology. Apart from these we cannot advance a step
in safety. The archæological evidence, however, is already
sufficient for the presumption that, where it fails us, the text is
nevertheless ancient, and the narrative historical—a presumption,
it will be noticed, the exact contrary of that in which
the Hexateuchal theory has landed its disciples.</p>

<p class='c003'>But, these same disciples will urge, what becomes of those
three strata of legislation which we have so successfully disentangled
one from the other in the Hexateuch, and have shown
to belong to three separate and mutually exclusive periods of
Israelitish history? Has not literary criticism proved that no
reconciliation is possible between the enactments and point of
view of the Book of the Covenant on the one side, and those of
the Deuteronomist on the other, or between the legislation of
the Deuteronomist and that of the Priestly Code? The altar of
earth or rough-hewn stones, which may be built on any high
place, makes way for the altar of the temple at Jerusalem, and
this again for the ideal altar of the tabernacle in the wilderness.
One sanctuary takes the place of many; the priesthood is
confined first to the tribe of Levi, and then more especially to
the sons of Aaron; while the simple feasts of harvest rejoicing,
which were celebrated by early Israel in common with its
neighbours, are replaced by sacrifices for sin and solemn
festivals like the Day of Atonement.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is strange that these inconsistencies were left to European
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>scholars of the nineteenth century to discover, and that neither
the contemporaries of Ezra, who allowed themselves to be
bound to the yoke of a law which they believed to be divine,
nor the Samaritan rivals of the Jews, should have ever perceived
them. The fact seems to the historian to throw some doubt
on their real existence, and he can leave them to the tender
mercies of Dr. Baxter, who has met the literary critics on their
own ground, and seriously damaged their house of cards.<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c013'><sup>[140]</sup></a>
The historian can have nothing to do with a theory which not
only requires the whole of the historical books of the Old
Testament to be rewritten in accordance with it, but also
declares at once every passage which tells against it to be a
gloss and interpolation. History, like science, is not built on
subjective judgments.</p>

<p class='c003'>At the same time, there is an element of truth in the work
of the ‘literary analysis.’ Years of labour on the part of able
and learned scholars cannot be absolutely without result, even
though the labourers may have been led astray by the will-o’-the-wisp
of a false theory and have followed a wrong line of
research. The minute examination to which they have subjected
the text has revealed much that had never before been
suspected; and they have made it clear that the historical
books of the Old Testament are compilations, not free, moreover,
from later interpolations, even though we cannot share
the confidence with which they separate and distinguish the
different elements. They have made it impossible ever to
return to the old conception of the Hebrew Scriptures and the
old method of treating Hebrew history. Where they have
been successful has been on the negative rather than on the
reconstructive side. For reconstruction, the scientific instrument
of comparison was wanted, and this the literary analysts
did not possess.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Old Testament books themselves make no secret of
the fact that they are compilations. The books of the Kings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>name the sources from which a large part of them has been
drawn, and the books of Samuel (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 18) quote David’s
‘Song of the Bow’ from the book of Jasher. The same work
is referred to in the book of Joshua (<abbr title='ten'>x.</abbr> 13), and in Numbers
(<abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 14) we have an extract from the lost Book of the Wars
of the Lord. Old poems are introduced into the text, like the
Song of Deborah or the Blessing of Jacob; even an Amorite
song of triumph is cited in Numbers <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 27-30. The so-called
‘Book of the Covenant’ of the literary critics takes its name
from a real ‘book of the covenant’ in which the first legislation
promulgated at Sinai was written down by Moses, according
to <abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-four'>xxiv.</abbr> 4, 7, and read by him ‘in the audience of
the people;’ while the Song of Deborah expressly states that
the forces of Zebulun, which took part in the war against
Sisera, were accompanied by scribes, like the armies of Egypt
or Assyria.</p>

<p class='c003'>That Moses could not have written the account of his own
death was discovered even by the Jewish rabbis; and references
to the ‘Book of the Covenant’ and the ‘Book of the
Wars of the Lord’ prove that the Pentateuch in its present
form has not come down to us from the Mosaic age. The
materials may be Mosaic; it may thus be substantially the
work of the great Hebrew lawgiver, but the actual work itself
is of later date.</p>

<p class='c003'>How far may we trust the accuracy of the traditional Hebrew
text? Modern criticism has been inclined to pronounce the
text corrupt, not unfrequently because the critic himself cannot
understand it, and to deal pretty freely in conjectural emendations.
The Greek text of the Septuagint is invoked against
it, and undue weight is often given to its variant readings
or omissions, as, for instance, in the case of the history of
Saul. Doubtless the Septuagint text is of great value; it goes
back to a period centuries older than the oldest Hebrew <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>MS.</span></abbr>
that has survived to us; but it was made by Jews of Alexandria,
whose knowledge of the sacred language of their
nation was not always complete or exact. The recent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>discovery of the original Hebrew text of Ecclesiasticus has
gone far to shake our confidence in the readings of the
Septuagint, as a comparison of it with the Greek translation
made only two generations later has shown that passages are
omitted in the latter, through simple carelessness, or perhaps
inability to understand them. The discovery has also not
been in favour of the emendations of literary and philological
criticism, not one of the many attempts made to restore the lost
Hebrew original having turned out to be correct.<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c013'><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>On the other hand, a comparison of the Hebrew Scriptures
with the clay books of Assyria is on the side of accuracy in the
text. The scribes employed in the libraries of Assyria, and
presumably, therefore, in the older libraries of Babylonia, were
scrupulously exact in their copies of earlier texts. Where the
tablet which they copied was injured and defective, it was
stated to be so, and the scribe made no attempt to fill up by
conjecture, however obvious, what was missing in the document
before him. He even was careful to note whether the
fracture was recent or not. Where, again, he was not certain
about the Assyrian equivalent of a Babylonian character of
unusual form, he gave alternative representatives of it, or else
reproduced the questionable character itself. Perhaps the
most striking example of the textual honesty of the Assyrian and
Babylonian scribes is, however, to be found in a compilation
known as the <i>Babylonian Chronicle</i>—a chronological abstract
in which the history of Babylonia is given from a strictly
Babylonian point of view. Here the author candidly confesses
that he does ‘not know’ the year when the decisive battle of
Khalulê took place, which laid Babylon at the feet of Sennacherib;
his materials for settling the matter failed him, and,
unlike the modern Hexateuchal critics, he abstained from
conjecture. We are more fortunate than he was; for, as we
possess the annals of Sennacherib, in which the Assyrian king
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>gives a highly-coloured account of the battle, we are able to
determine its date.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the later days of the Jewish monarchy there was a library
at Jerusalem similar to those of Assyria and Babylonia, and
we hear of the scribes belonging to it in the days of Hezekiah
re-editing the Proverbs of Solomon (Prov. <abbr title='twenty-five'>xxv.</abbr> 1). There are
indications that they were as careful and honest in their work
as the scribes of Assyria whose example they probably followed.
Thus the names of Chedor-laomer and his allies are preserved
with singular correctness, as well as the forms of two
geographical names which seem to imply translation from a
cuneiform original.<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c013'><sup>[142]</sup></a> So, again, the Aramaic inscriptions of a
contemporary of Tiglath-pileser <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> found at Sinjerli, north of
the Gulf of Antioch, show that in one case at least the spelling
which we find in the books of Kings has remained unchanged
since the eighth century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> As in the books of Kings, so at
Sinjerli, the Assyrian name Tukulti-Pal-Esarra is incorrectly
written Tiglath-pileser, with <abbr class='spell'><i>g</i></abbr> instead of <abbr class='spell'><i>k</i></abbr>, and even the
country over which he ruled is in both cases written <i>plene</i>
(with the symbol of the vowel <abbr class='spell'><i>u</i></abbr>). On the other hand, it cannot
be denied that there are many clear and unmistakable corruptions
of the text. In the fourteenth chapter of Genesis itself
the name of the city Larsa has been transformed into Ellasar;<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c013'><sup>[143]</sup></a>
elsewhere glosses have been received into the text, while there
are whole passages which are either ungrammatical or unmeaning
as they now stand. Ancient authors, whether Hebrew or
otherwise, did not write nonsense; and if the natural rendering
of a passage does not make sense, we may feel quite sure that
it is corrupt.</p>

<p class='c003'>The historian of the Hebrews, then, is bound to treat his
authorities as the Greek historian would treat Herodotos or
Thucydides or any other writer on behalf of whose character
and age there is a long line of external testimony. The results
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>of the ‘literary analysis’ may be left to the philologist, as well
as the conjectures and theories that have been substituted by
scholars of the nineteenth century for early Israelitish history.
They have vanished like bubbles wherever they have been
tested by the archæological evidence, which, on the other
hand, has vindicated the substantial truthfulness of those Old
Testament statements which had been scornfully thrown aside.</p>

<p class='c003'>Where it is possible, the Biblical narratives must be compared
with the discoveries of archæological research; where
this cannot be done, they must be examined from the historical
and not from the philological or literary point of view. We
are bound to assume their general credibility and faithfulness,
except where this can be historically disproved, and to
remember that while on the one hand inconsistencies in detail
do not affect the general historical trustworthiness of a document,
the agreement of such details with the facts of
archæology or geography—more especially when they are of
the kind termed ‘undesigned coincidences’—is a powerful
argument in its favour. Above all, we must beware of that
favourite weapon of literary criticism, the argument from
silence, which is really merely an argument from the imperfection
of our own knowledge, and which a single instance to the
contrary will overthrow. The literary criticism of the Old
Testament is full of examples of the argument that have been
demolished by the advance of Oriental archæology.</p>

<p class='c003'>Let this accordingly be the rule of the historian: to believe
all things, to hope all things, but at the same time to test and
try all things. And the test must be scientific, not what we
assume to be probable or natural, but external testimony in
the shape of archæological or geographical facts. The history
of the past is not what ought to have happened according to
the ideas of the critic, but what actually did happen.</p>

<p class='c003'>Such a manner of treating our authorities does not, of
course, exclude our recognition of what the literary critics call
their several ‘tendencies.’ No history, worthy of the name,
can be written without a ‘tendency’ of some sort on the part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>of the writer, even though it be not consciously felt. We must
have some kind of general theory within the lines of which our
facts may be grouped; and however much we may strive to be
impartial, our conception of the facts themselves, and our mode
of presenting them, will be coloured by our beliefs and education.
The historian cannot help writing with an object in
view; the necessities of the subject require it.</p>

<p class='c003'>That the historical books of the Old Testament should have
been written with a ‘tendency’ is therefore natural. And
literary criticism has successfully pointed out in the case of
one of these books what the ‘tendency’ was. If we compare
the books of Chronicles with those of Samuel and Kings, the
contrast between them strikes the eye at once. The interest
of the Chronicler is centred in the history of the Jewish temple
and ritual, of its priests and Levites, and the manifold requirements
of the Law. His history of Israel accordingly becomes
a history of Israelitish ritual; all else is put aside or treated in
the briefest fashion. The incidents of David’s reign narrated
in the books of Samuel are subordinated to elaborate accounts
of his arrangements for the services in the tabernacle or
temple; the history of the northern kingdom of Israel, which
lay outside that of the temple at Jerusalem, is passed over in
silence; and the Passover held in Hezekiah’s reign, about
which not a word is said in the books of Kings, is dwelt upon
to the exclusion of almost everything else. Nor, had we only
the Chronicler in our hands, should we know that the pious
Hezekiah had entered into an alliance with the Babylonian
king and boastfully displayed to his ambassadors the treasures
of the Jewish kingdom, thereby bringing upon himself the
rebuke of the prophet Isaiah. All that the Chronicler has to
say on the matter is that ‘in the business of the ambassadors
of the prince of Babylon, who sent to inquire of the wonder
that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he
might know all that was in his heart’; and even here a
theological turn is given to the occurrence by the motive
assigned for the embassy. As a matter of fact, we know from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>the cuneiform inscriptions that the real object of Merodach-baladan
was to form a league with the princes of the West
against their common Assyrian enemy, to which, as the books
of Kings inform us, was naturally added a polite inquiry after
Hezekiah’s health.</p>

<p class='c003'>‘Tendencies’ there are, therefore, in the historical writings
of the Old Testament; they would not be human productions
if there were not. The authors have had one great object in
view, that of showing from the past history of the people that
sin brings punishment with it, while a blessing follows upon
righteous action. They believed in the Divine government of
the world, and wrote with that belief clearly before them.
They believed also that Israel was the chosen nation in whose
history that Divine government had been made manifest to
mankind, and that the God of Israel was the one true
omnipotent God. In this belief in a theodicy they were
theologians, like most other Oriental writers. But their
theological point of view did not prevent them from being
historians as well. It did not interfere with their honestly
recording the course of events as it had been handed down to
them, or reproducing their authorities without intentional
change. Doubtless they may have made mistakes at times,
their judgment may not always have been strictly critical or
correct, and want of sufficient materials may now and then
have led them into error. But when we find that no attempt
is made to palliate or conceal the sins and shortcomings of
their most cherished national heroes, that even the reverses
of the nation are chronicled equally with its successes, and
that the early period of its history is confessed to have been
one of anarchy and crime, and not the golden age of which
popular (and even historical) imagination loves to dream, we
are justified in according to them, in spite of their theological
‘tendencies,’ a considerable measure of confidence.</p>

<p class='c003'>It will have been noticed that chronology—the skeleton, as
it were, on which the flesh of history is laid—has been alluded
to in the previous chapter only in the vaguest possible manner.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>‘The age of Abraham,’ ‘the age of the Exodus,’ ‘the Mosaic
age,’ are the phrases that have been used in referring to Old
Testament events. Israelitish chronology in the true sense of
the word does not begin till the reign of David, and even then
we have to deal with probabilities rather than with facts. Like
Egyptian history, which has to be measured by dynasties
instead of dates before the rise of the eighteenth dynasty, the
early history of the Hebrews has no chronological record.
Before we can attach dates to the events of the patriarchal
period or the Exodus, it is necessary to find synchronisms
between them and the dated history of other peoples.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is a commonplace of Biblical students that numbers are
peculiarly liable to corruption, and that consequently little
dependence can be placed on the numbers given in the text of
the Old Testament. But the conclusion does not follow from
the premiss. The later dates of Israelitish history are for the
most part reliable, and it would be strange if the causes of
corruption were fatal only to the dates of an earlier period.
Moreover, the numbers fit into a self-consistent system, the
several fractions of which agree with the whole summation.
Such a self-consistent system would perhaps demand acceptance
were it not that there are three such systems, rivals one of
the other, and mutually incompatible. One is that of the
Massoretic Hebrew text, which makes the period from the
Creation to the call of Abraham exactly 2000 solar years (or,
2056 lunar years), 1600 of which extend from the Creation to
the Deluge, and the remaining 400 from the Deluge to the
call of Abraham. A second is that of the Septuagint, according
to which the period from the Creation to the Flood is 2200
solar years (or, 2262 lunar years), 1600 of these elapsing between
the Creation and the birth of Noah, and 600 from that
event to the Flood, while 1200 are counted from the Flood to
the call of the patriarch. The third is that of the Samaritan
text which divides the period into two halves of 1200 years
each; the first 1200 comprising the time from the Creation
to the birth of the sons of Noah, and the second 1200 the rest
of the period.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>It is obvious that all these systems are like the similar
chronological systems of the Egyptians, the Babylonians, or
the Hindus, mere artificial schemes of an astronomical
character, and differing from the latter only in their more
modest computation of time. For historical purposes they are
worthless, and indicate merely that materials for a chronology
were entirely wanting. The ages assigned to the patriarchs
before the Flood, for example, stand on a level with the reigns
of the ten antediluvian kings of Chaldæa which are extended
over 120 sari, or 432,000 years. The post-diluvian patriarchs are
in no better position; indeed, one of them, Arphaxad, is a
geographical title, and the Septuagint interpolates after him a
certain Kainan, of whom neither the Hebrew nor the
Samaritan text knows anything.</p>

<p class='c003'>Even after the call of Abraham, Hebrew chronology is
equally uncertain. The length of life assigned to Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob is surprising, though not quite impossible, but
the dates connected with it do not always agree together.
How, for example, can Abraham have had six children after
the death of Sarah (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-five'>xxv.</abbr> 1, 2), when the birth of Isaac
nearly forty years before had been regarded as extraordinary
on account of the patriarch’s age? Or, again, to quote the
words of Professor Driver<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c013'><sup>[144]</sup></a>: ‘Do we all realise that according
to the chronology of the Book of Genesis (<abbr title='twenty-five'>xxv.</abbr> 26, <abbr title='twenty-six'>xxvi.</abbr> 34,
<abbr title='thirty-five'>xxxv.</abbr> 28) [Isaac] must have been lying upon his deathbed
for <i>eighty years</i>? Yet we can only diminish this period by
extending proportionately the interval between Esau’s marrying
his Hittite wives (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-six'>xxvi.</abbr> 34), and Rebekah’s suggestion to
Isaac to send Jacob away, lest he should follow his brother’s
example (<abbr title='twenty-seven'>xxvii.</abbr> 46), which from the nature of the case will not
admit of any but a slight extension. Keil, however, does so
extend it, reducing the period of Isaac’s final illness to forty-three
years, and is conscious of no incongruity in supposing
that Rebekah, <i>thirty-seven</i> years after Esau has taken his
Hittite wives, should express her fear that Jacob, then aged
seventy-seven, will do the same!’</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>The length of the period during which the Israelites were in
Egypt has been the subject of endless controversy. The Old
Testament statements in regard to it are clear enough.
Abraham is told (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 13) that his descendants shall
‘serve’ the Egyptians and be ‘afflicted’ by them for 400
years. As a generation was counted at thirty years, this
implies that the whole period spent in Egypt was 430 years,
though the statement is not quite exact, since Joseph lived
more than thirty years after the settlement of his brethren in
the land of Goshen, and their servitude and affliction did not
begin till after his death. In Exodus (<abbr title='twelve'>xii.</abbr> 40) we are informed
explicitly that ‘the sojourning of the children of Israel, who
dwelt in Egypt, was 430 years.’ Four hundred and thirty
years, therefore, must have been the length of time during
which Israel was officially regarded as having lived in Goshen.</p>

<p class='c003'>But it is difficult to reconcile it with another statement in
<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 16, where it is said that ‘in the fourth generation’
the children of Israel should return to Canaan. As the words
were spoken to Abraham, the fourth generation would be that
of Joseph himself. Since this seems out of the question, they
are usually interpreted to refer to Moses and Aaron, who are
placed in the fourth generation from Levi. Moses and Aaron,
however, did not ‘come again’ to Palestine, and the genealogy
of the daughters of Zelophehad (<abbr title='Numbers'>Num.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-seven'>xxvii.</abbr> 1) makes the
generation that did so the seventh from Joseph. Time, in
fact, cannot be reckoned by generations; we do not know
how many links in the chain may have been dropped, ‘son’
in Semitic idiom being frequently equivalent to ‘descendant,’
while the names are often merely geographical, like Gilead and
Machir in the genealogy of Zelophehad, and therefore have no
chronological value. It was, however, the mention of ‘the fourth.
generation’ which produced the rabbinical gloss, alluded
to by <abbr title='Saint'>S.</abbr> Paul (<abbr title='Galatians'>Gal.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 17), according to which the four
hundred and thirty years of <abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 13 did not mean the time
during which the Israelites were ‘afflicted’ in Egypt, but—in
spite of the definite assertion to the contrary—a period which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>included the lives of the patriarchs as well as the government
of Joseph.</p>

<p class='c003'>If the statements in regard to the period of the Israelitish
settlement in Egypt are contradictory, the statements in regard
to the lapse of time from the conquest of Canaan to the
building of Solomon’s temple are still more so. In 1 Kings
<abbr title='six'>vi.</abbr> 1 we read that the foundations of the temple were laid in
the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, and four hundred and eighty
years after the Exodus from Egypt. If we add together the
numbers given in the book of Judges, they amount to four
hundred and ten years, thus leaving only seventy years for the
wanderings in the desert, the judgeships of Eli and Samuel,
the reigns of Saul and David, and the first four years of
Solomon! The endeavours that have been made to get over
the difficulty have all been fruitless. Wellhausen and others,
for instance, have conjectured that the four hundred and eighty
years are intended to represent twelve generations, each being
reckoned at forty years, and the seventy years assigned to the
five ‘lesser judges’ being overlooked. But the conjecture is
destitute of support, and is contrary to such notices as we have
of the number of generations which covered the period of the
judges. Moreover, the five lesser judges do not constitute a
group by themselves.</p>

<p class='c003'>The period of four hundred and eighty years cannot be
reconciled with the genealogies any better than with the
apparent chronology of the book of Judges. Between Nahshon,
who was a contemporary of Moses, and Solomon, only five
generations are given (Ruth <abbr title='four'>iv.</abbr> 20-22); and between Phinehas
and Zadok, whom Solomon removed from the priesthood,
there were only seven generations of priests (1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='six'>vi.</abbr> 4-8).
Doubtless some of the links in the ancestry of David have
been dropped, but that can hardly be the case as regards the
priests. Seven generations would give, at the most, not more
than two hundred and ten years.</p>

<p class='c003'>That the number four hundred and eighty, however, has
really been based on the number forty seems probable. Forty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>years in Hebrew idiom merely signified an indeterminate and
unknown period of time, and the Moabite Stone shows that
the same idiom existed also in the Moabite language.<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c013'><sup>[145]</sup></a> Thus
Absalom is said, in 2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 7, to have asked permission to
leave Jerusalem ‘after forty years,’ although the length of time
was really little more than two years (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 28 <abbr class='spell'><i>sqq.</i></abbr>), and
Jewish tradition has supplied the lost record of the length of
Saul’s reign with a date of forty years. The period of forty
years, which meets us again and again in the book of Judges,
is simply the equivalent of an unknown length of time; it
denotes the want of materials, and the consequent ignorance
of the writer. Twenty, the half of forty, is equally an expression
of ignorance; and the only dates available for chronology
are those which represent a definite space of time, like the
eight years of Chushan-rishathaim’s oppression of Israel, or
the six years of Jephthah’s judgeship.</p>

<p class='c003'>We can learn nothing, accordingly, from the books of the
Old Testament about the chronology of Israel down to the
time of David. For David’s reign we have the seven years of
his rule at Hebron, followed by the thirty-three years of his
sway over the whole of Israel. For the reign of Solomon we
have again the indeterminate ‘forty years’; but since Rezon
of Damascus, like Hadad of Edom, was ‘an adversary to
Israel all the days of Solomon,’ it is probable that the reign
did not actually last more than thirty years at the most. Even
the chronology of the divided kingdom after the death of
Solomon, in spite of the synchronisms the compiler of the
books of Kings has endeavoured to establish between the
kings of Judah and those of Israel, has been the despair of
historians, and scheme after scheme has been proposed in
order to make it self-consistent. The Assyrian monuments,
however, have now come to our help, and shown that between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>the time of Ahab and that of Hezekiah it is forty years in
excess.</p>

<p class='c003'>For Hebrew chronology, therefore, we must look outside
the Bible itself. At certain points Hebrew history comes into
touch with the monumental records of Egypt, Babylonia, and
Assyria; and if we are to date the events it records, it must be
by their aid. Egypt can assist us only after the rise of the
eighteenth dynasty; before that period it is as much without
a chronology as the Israelites themselves. But the case is
different as regards Babylonia and Assyria. In Babylonia
time was dated by the reigns of the kings and the events of
the several years of each reign. The extensive commercial
relations of the country, and the contracts that were constantly
being drawn up, made accurate dating a matter of necessity.
The Assyrians were even more exact than the Babylonians;
they were distinguished among Oriental nations by their strong
historical sense, and at an early epoch had devised an accurate
system of chronology. The years were reckoned by a succession
of officers called <i>limmi</i>, each of whom held office for a
year and gave his name to it, the king himself, during the
earlier period of Assyrian history, taking the office in the first
year of his reign. Lists of the <i>limmi</i> were kept, and a reference
to them would show at once the exact age of a document
dated by the name of a particular <i>limmu</i>. None of the lists
hitherto discovered are, unfortunately, older than the tenth
century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>; but, thanks to those that have been found, from
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 909 to 666 we have a continuous and accurate register of
time.</p>

<p class='c003'>Abraham was the contemporary of Chedor-laomer and Amraphel,
and the position of Amraphel among the Babylonian kings
has been given us by the native annalists. He was the sixth
king of the first dynasty of Babylon, and reigned fifty-five
years. Unfortunately, the only copy we possess at present of
the native Babylonian list of dynasties is broken, and owing
to the fracture of the tablet, a doubt hangs over his precise
date. The most probable restoration of the text would make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>it about <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 2300.<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c013'><sup>[146]</sup></a> Between this and the Exodus there would
be an interval of more than a thousand years.</p>

<p class='c003'>Dr. Mahler has attempted to fix astronomically the dates of
the two leading Pharaohs of the eighteenth and nineteenth
dynasties, Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> and Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, and his dates have
been accepted by Brugsch and other Egyptologists. If his
calculations are correct, Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> will have reigned from
the <abbr title='twentieth'>20th</abbr> of March <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1503 to the <abbr title='fourteenth'>14th</abbr> of February <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1449;<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c013'><sup>[147]</sup></a>
and Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, the Pharaoh of the oppression, from <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1348
to 1281. The eighteenth dynasty, accordingly, would have
commenced about <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1600, and the Exodus would have
taken place subsequently to <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1280.</p>

<p class='c003'>If Apophis <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> was the Hyksos king under whom Joseph
governed Egypt, he would have lived four generations before
Ahmes, the founder of the eighteenth dynasty.<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c013'><sup>[148]</sup></a> The ‘four
hundred years,’ therefore, during which Israel was evil-entreated
in Egypt (Acts <abbr title='seven'>vii.</abbr> 6) will correspond with the era of four
hundred years mentioned on a stela discovered by Mariette at
San, the ancient Zoan.<a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c013'><sup>[149]</sup></a> The stela commemorates a visit paid
to Zoan in the reign of Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> by Seti, the governor of
the frontier, on the fourth day of the month Mesori, and ‘the
four hundredth year of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt,
Set-âa-pehti, the son of the Sun, who loved him, also named
Set-Nubti, beloved of Harmakhis.’ Since Set or Sutekh was
the Hyksos god, and Zoan the Hyksos capital, it is clear that
we have here a Hyksos era, the four hundredth anniversary of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>which fell in the reign of Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> It seems probable that
it marked the accession of the third and last Hyksos dynasty.
According to Manetho, as reported by Africanus, this lasted for
one hundred and fifty-one years, which would take us to about
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1720, and the same date is obtained if we calculate the four
hundred years of the stela of Sân, back from the thirtieth year
of Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> One generation more—the thirty additional
years given in <abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='twelve'>xii.</abbr> 40—will bring us to the period of the
Exodus, which, as we shall see hereafter, must have taken place
under Meneptah, the son and successor of Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr></p>

<p class='c003'>The precise connection between the Hyksos and Hebrew
eras must be left to the future to discover. At present, the
only reference found to the first is that on the stela of Sân.
Some connection, however, there must be between them, like
the connection between Zoan and Hebron indicated in <abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr>
<abbr title='thirteen'>xiii.</abbr> 22, where it is said that ‘Hebron was built seven years
before Zoan in Egypt.’ The Hyksos were invaders from Asia,
and between them and the Hebrews there may have been a
closer relationship than we now suspect.</p>

<p class='c003'>Two approximate dates have accordingly been found for early
Hebrew history. One results from the synchronism between
Abraham and Amraphel, and may be set down as about 2300
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr>; the other is the synchronism with Egyptian history, which
gives us about <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1720 for the settlement of the Hebrew tribes
in Goshen. We must now see what light can be thrown by
the Egyptian monuments on the date of the Exodus.</p>

<p class='c003'>Various reasons had led an increasing majority of Egyptologists
to regard Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, the most prominent figure in the
nineteenth dynasty, if not in the whole history of the Pharaohs,
as the Pharaoh of the Oppression, and the question was finally
settled by Dr. Naville’s excavations at Tel el-Maskhûta on
behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund.<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c013'><sup>[150]</sup></a> Tel el-Maskhûta
proved to be the site of Pi-Tum, the Biblical Pithom, and to
have had the civil name of Thuku or Thukut from the nome
of the district in which it was situated. Brugsch had already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>pointed out that Thukut is the Succoth of the Old Testament,
the Egyptian <abbr class='spell'><i>th</i></abbr> corresponding to the Hebrew <abbr class='spell'><i>’s</i></abbr>, and Succoth
was the first stage in the flight of the Israelites after their
departure from Raamses (<abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='twelve'>xii.</abbr> 37). Pi-Tum was the
sacred name of the city, which was dedicated to Tum, the
setting Sun.</p>

<p class='c003'>The monuments found on the spot showed that the founder
of the city was Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>; and since the Pharaoh of the
Oppression was also the builder of Pithom (<abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 11),
those who attach any credit to the historical character of the
Biblical statement must necessarily see in him the great
Pharaoh of the nineteenth dynasty. The conclusion is further
supported by the name of ‘Raamses,’ or Ramses, the second
of the two cities which it is said the Hebrews were employed
in building. Ramses <abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr>, the founder of the nineteenth dynasty,
and the grandfather of Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, was the first king of Egypt
who bore that name; and the shortness of his reign, which
does not seem to have exceeded two years, as well as the
disturbed condition of the country, would have prevented him
from undertaking any architectural works. Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, however,
was essentially a building Pharaoh; he covered Egypt
from one end to the other with his constructions; he founded
cities, erected or restored monuments, and not unfrequently
usurped them. There was more than one city or temple of
Ramses which owed its existence to his architectural zeal and
was called after his name. As the date of the third Ramses
of the twentieth dynasty is too late to fit in with any theory
of the Exodus, there remains only Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> for ‘the treasure-city’
mentioned in Exodus. Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> restored Zoan, and
made it a seat of residence; this will explain why, in <abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr>
<abbr title='forty-seven'>xlvii.</abbr> 11, Goshen is proleptically said to have been situated in
‘the land of Rameses.’ Brugsch has made it probable that
‘the city of Ramses’ referred to in an Egyptian papyrus was
Zoan itself.<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c013'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>If Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> was the Pharaoh of the Oppression, the
Pharaoh of the Exodus will have been one of his immediate
successors. The choice lies between Meneptah <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, who succeeded
him, his grandson, the feeble Seti <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, and the usurper
Si-Ptah, with whom the dynasty came to an inglorious end.
The Egyptian legend of the Exodus given by Manetho places
it in the reign of Meneptah; and a stela discovered at Thebes
in 1896 by Professor Petrie makes any other dating difficult.
Here the ‘Israelites’ are spoken of as having been brought
low, ‘so that no seed should be left to them’; and since their
name alone is without the determinative of locality which is
added to the names of all the other conquered populations
associated with them, we may conclude that they had already
been lost in the desert, and, so far at any rate as was known
to the Egyptian scribe, had no fixed local habitation.<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c013'><sup>[152]</sup></a> As
this was in the fifth year of Meneptah’s reign, <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1276,
according to Dr. Mahler’s chronology, the Exodus from Egypt
may be approximately assigned to <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1277. The period of
oppression, according to the calculation in <abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 13, would
consequently have commenced in <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1677, or nearly a
hundred years before the expulsion of the Hyksos.</p>

<p class='c003'>It must be remembered, however, that the date is more
precise in appearance than in reality. It depends partly on
the accuracy of Dr. Mahler’s calculations, which is disputed
by Professors Eisenlohr and Maspero, partly on our regarding
the round number 400 as representing an exact period of
time. If we knew in what year of Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>’s long reign of
sixty-seven years the stela of Sân was inscribed, we should be
better able to check the reckoning. As it is, we have to be
grateful for what we have already learned from the excavated
monuments of the past, and to look forward with confidence
to more light and certainty in the future.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There arose up a new king over Egypt which knew not
Joseph.’ Commentators on the passage have often imagined
that this event followed almost immediately upon the death
of Joseph and his generation. So, too, it was supposed before
the decipherment of the Assyrian inscriptions that the murder
of Sennacherib took place immediately after his return from
Palestine. In both cases the student had been misled by the
brevity of the Hebrew narrative, and that foreshortening of
the past which causes events to be grouped together even
though they may have been separated by an interval of many
years. In the present instance, however, the Biblical writer
has done his best to indicate that the interval was a long one.
Before the rise of ‘the new king which knew not Joseph,’ the
children of Israel had had time to ‘increase abundantly,’ to
‘multiply’ so that ‘the land was filled with them.’ The family
of Jacob had become a tribe, or rather a collection of tribes.
They had become dangerous to their rulers; the Pharaoh is
even made to say that they were ‘more and mightier than’ the
Egyptians themselves. In case of invasion, they might assist
the enemy and expose Egypt to another Asiatic conquest.</p>

<p class='c003'>Hence came the determination to transform them into public
serfs, and even to destroy the males altogether. The free
Bedâwin-like settlers in Goshen, who had kept apart from
their Egyptian neighbours, and had been unwilling to perform
even agricultural work, were made the slaves of the State.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>They were taken from their herds and sheep, from their independent
life on the outskirts of the Delta, and compelled to
toil under the lash of the Egyptian taskmaster and build for
the Pharaoh his ‘treasure-cities’ of Pithom and Raamses.</p>

<p class='c003'>Egypt is the most conservative of countries, and the children
of Israel still have their representatives in it. The Bedâwin
still feed their flocks and enjoy an independent existence on
the outskirts of the cultivated land, and in that very district
of Goshen where the descendants of Jacob once dwelt.
Even when they adopt a settled agriculturist life, like the
villagers of Gizeh, they still claim immunity from the
burdens of their fellahin neighbours on the ground of their
Bedâwin descent. They are exempt from the conscription and
the <i>corvée</i>, the modern equivalents of the forced brickmaking
of the Mosaic age. The attempt to interfere with these
privileges has actually led to an exodus in our own time.<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c013'><sup>[153]</sup></a>
The Wadi Tumilât, the Goshen of old days, was colonised
with Arabs from the Nejd and Babylonia by Mohammed Ali,
who wished to employ them in the culture of the silkworm.
Here they lived with their flocks and cattle, protected by the
Government, and exempt from taxation, from military service,
and the <i>corvée</i>. Mohammed Ali died, however, and an
attempt was then made to force them into the army, and lay
upon them the ordinary burdens of taxation. Thereupon, in
a single night, the whole population silently departed with all
their possessions, leaving behind them nothing but the hearths
of their forsaken homes. They made their way back to their
kinsfolk eastward of Egypt, and the Wadi remained deserted
until <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> de Lesseps carried through it the Freshwater Canal.</p>

<p class='c003'>We owe to Dr. Naville the recovery of Goshen. In 1884
he excavated at Saft el-Henna an ancient mound close to the
line of railway between Zagazig and Tel el-Kebîr. The
monuments he found there showed that the mound represents
the ancient Qosem or Qos, called Pha-kussa by the
Greek geographers, which was the capital of the Arabian nome.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>The Septuagint, with its Gesem instead of Goshen, implies
that the site of Goshen was still remembered in Alexandrine
times.<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c013'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The Arabian nome took its name not only from its proximity
to Arabia, but also from the fact that its inhabitants were
mainly of the Arab race. But the name did not come into
existence until after the age of the nineteenth dynasty. When
Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> was Pharaoh, the whole region from the neighbourhood
of Cairo to the Suez Canal was included in the nome of
On or Heliopolis. It was only at a subsequent date that the
nomes of Arabia and of Bubastis were carved out of that
of On.</p>

<p class='c003'>Previously to this, Qosem was the name of a district as
well as of its chief city. It comprised not only the fertile
fields immediately surrounding Saft el-Henna, and stretching
from the mounds of Bubastis, close to Zagazig, on the west to
Tel el-Kebîr on the east, but also the Wadi Tumilât, through
which the railway now runs eastward as far as Ismailiya.
Belbeis, south of Zagazig, was also included within its limits.
At the eastern extremity of the Wadi was Pithom, now marked
by the ruins of Tel el-Maskhûta.</p>

<p class='c003'>Meneptah <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, the Pharaoh of the Exodus, thus refers at
Karnak to the arable land about Pi-Bailos, the modern
Belbeis. ‘The country around it,’ he says, ‘is not cultivated,
but left as pasture for cattle because of the foreigners. It has
been abandoned (to them) since ancient times.’ They had
settled with their herds in the neighbouring-valley of Tumilât,
and the richer land which adjoined the valley was also assigned
to them. Here they were in the nome of Heliopolis, the
daughter of whose high-priest was married by Joseph, as well
as in the near neighbourhood of Bubastis, where Dr. Naville
has found Hyksos remains.</p>

<p class='c003'>When the great inscription of Meneptah <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> was engraved
on the walls of Karnak the Exodus would have already taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>place. The ‘foreigners,’ therefore, to whom he alludes must
have been the Israelites, who had now deserted the spot.
The district accordingly would once more have needed
inhabitants, and the Pharaoh had the power of handing it
over to the first Bedâwin tribe who begged for pasturage in
the Delta. He had not long to wait. Among the papyri in
the British Museum there is a letter dated in the eighth year
of Meneptah’s reign, and addressed to the king. In this the
scribe writes as follows:—‘Another matter for the consideration
of my master’s heart. We have allowed the tribes of the
Shasu from the land of Edom to pass the fortress of Meneptah
in the land of Thukut (Succoth), (and go) to the lakes of
Pithom of Meneptah in the land of Thukut, in order to feed
themselves, and to feed their herds on the great estate of
Pharaoh, the beneficent sun of all countries. In the year 8.’<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c013'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The Wâdi Tumilât was accordingly regarded as crown-land,
as indeed it is to-day, and it was handed over to the Edomites
by officers of the Pharaoh, just as it had been to the Israelites
several centuries before. But now the Israelites had fled
from it, and disappeared into the wilderness, and it was
necessary to fill their place.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Biblical writer distinguishes the Pharaoh of the Oppression
from the Pharaoh of the Exodus (<abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii.</abbr> 23). It was
after the death of the great royal builder of Egypt that the
Hebrews were delivered from their bondage. The Pharaoh
of the Oppression and not the Pharaoh of the Exodus was
‘the new king which knew not Joseph.’</p>

<p class='c003'>The full meaning of the phrase has been explained to us by
the tablets of Tel el-Amarna. They have made it clear that
towards the end of the eighteenth dynasty the Egyptian court
became semi-Asiatic. The Pharaohs married Asiatic wives;
and eventually Amenophis <abbr title='the fourth'><span class='fss'>IV.</span></abbr>, under the influence of his
mother Teie, publicly abandoned the religion of which he
was the official head, and avowed himself a convert to an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Asiatic form of faith. Amon, the god of Thebes, was dethroned
by a new deity, Aten-Ra, ‘the Solar Disk.’ The
Solar Disk, however, was but the visible manifestation of the
one Supreme God, who was diffused throughout nature, and
corresponded in many respects with the Semitic Baal. The
Egyptians accordingly identified him with Ra, the ancient
Sun-god of Heliopolis, who in earlier times had similarly been
identified with the Hyksos Baal.</p>

<p class='c003'>Amenophis, the cast of whose face taken immediately after
death displays the features and expression of a philosopher
and enthusiast,<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c013'><sup>[156]</sup></a> endeavoured to force the new faith upon his
unwilling subjects. The very name of Amon was proscribed
and was erased wherever it occurred, the followers of the old
religion of Egypt were persecuted, and the Pharaoh changed
his own name to that of Khu-n-Aten, ‘the radiance of the
Solar Disk.’ A violent struggle ensued with the powerful
hierarchy of Thebes. Khu-n-Aten was finally compelled to
leave the capital of his fathers, and build himself a new city
further north, where its site is now marked by the mounds of
Tel el-Amarna. He carried with him the State-archives, consisting
mainly of foreign correspondence in the Babylonian
language and cuneiform script, and these were deposited in
one of the public buildings adjoining the palace, every brick
of which was stamped with the words, ‘Aten-Ra! the Record-Office.’<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c013'><sup>[157]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The palace itself was a marvel of art. Its walls and
columns were encrusted with precious stones, with gold and
with bronze, and it was adorned with painting and statuary,
some of which reminds us of Greek art in its best period.
Even the floors were frescoed with pictures of birds and
animals, of flowers and trees. The new religion was accompanied
by a new form of art, which cast aside the traditions
of Egypt, and looked rather to Asiatic models. It strove
after a realism which was sometimes exaggerated, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>always in strange contrast to the conventionalism of Egyptian
art. Hard by the gardens of the palace rose the temple of
Aten-Ra in the centre of the city. Like the palace, it was
gorgeous with ornament. But it contained no image of the
deity to whom it was consecrated. His symbol, the Disk,
was alone permitted to appear. The pantheistic monotheism
of the Pharaoh thus anticipated the puritanism of the Israelitish
Law.</p>

<p class='c003'>We learn from the inscriptions that Khu-n-Aten was not
contented with making himself the high-priest of the new
faith. Daily in the morning he gave instruction in it,
expounding its mysteries to those who would listen to him.
Acceptance of its doctrines was naturally a passport to the
offices of State. Many of these had long been held by
Asiatics, more especially by Syrians and Canaanites, and
under Khu-n-Aten these foreign immigrants more and more
usurped the highest functions of the Government. The native
Egyptians saw themselves excluded from the posts which had
brought them not only dignity, but wealth. Naturally, therefore,
the bitter feelings engendered by the war waged against
the old religion of Egypt were increased by this promotion of
the stranger to the offices of State which they had regarded as
their own. The Canaan they had conquered had revenged
itself by conquering their king. Not only religion, but self-interest
also, urged the native Egyptian to put an end to the
reforming schemes of the Pharaoh, and to religious animosity
was added race hatred as well.</p>

<p class='c003'>The storm broke shortly before Khu-n-Aten’s death. His
mummy indeed was laid in the magnificent grave he had
excavated in the recesses of a desolate mountain-valley, but the
granite sarcophagus in which it was deposited was never placed
in the niche prepared for it, but was hacked to pieces by his
enemies as it lay in the columned hall of the tomb, while the
body within it was torn to shreds. Nor was his mother Teie
ever laid by his side. Even the bodies of his dead daughters
were maltreated and despoiled.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Khu-n-Aten was followed by one or two short-lived Pharaohs
in the city he had built. Then the end came. The city was
destroyed, the stones of its temple were transported elsewhere
to furnish materials for the sanctuaries of the victorious Amon,
and such of the adherents of the new faith as could not escape
from the country either apostatised or were slain. A new king
arose who represented the national party and the worship of
the national god, and the Semitic strangers who had governed
Egypt as European strangers govern it to-day disappeared for
a time from the land. Their kinsfolk who remained, like the
Israelites in Goshen, were reduced to the condition of public
slaves.</p>

<p class='c003'>Here, then, is the explanation of the rise of that ‘new king
which knew not Joseph.’ We must see in him, not the
founder of the eighteenth dynasty who expelled the Hyksos,
but Ramses <abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr>, the founder of the nineteenth dynasty, with
whom all danger of Asiatic domination in Egypt came finally
to an end. The nineteenth dynasty represented the national
reaction against the Asiatic faith of Khu-n-Aten and the
government of the country by Asiatic officials. It meant
Egypt as against Asia. And the policy of the new rulers of
Egypt was not long in declaring itself. Ramses <abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> indeed
reigned too short a time to do more than establish his
family firmly on the throne; but his son and successor, Seti
Meneptah <abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr>, once more overran Syria and made Palestine an
Egyptian province; while Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, who followed him, took
measures to prevent such of the Asiatics as were still in
Egypt from ever again becoming formidable to the native
population.</p>

<p class='c003'>The causes that led to the enslavement of the Israelites and
to the Exodus out of Egypt were the same as those which in
our own day led to the rebellion of Arabi. Religious and race
hatreds were mingled together, and the ‘national party’ which
grudged to the foreigner his share in the spoils of government
aimed at destroying both him and his religion. Ramses <abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr>,
however, was more fortunate than Arabi. No foreign power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>came to the help of the Syrian settlers on the Nile, and the
leader of the Egyptian patriots became the favourite of the
Theban priesthood and the sovereign of Egypt. From this
time forward we hear no more of the use of the Babylonian
language and script in the public correspondence of the
Egyptians.</p>

<p class='c003'>The oppression of the Israelites, then, is a natural and
necessary part of the political history of the nineteenth
dynasty. It fits in with the policy which the dynasty was
placed on the throne to carry out. And an inscription discovered
by Professor Flinders Petrie in 1896 supplements the
story in an unexpected way. It was engraved by order of
Meneptah <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, the son and successor of Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, on a large
slab of granite, and placed in a temple he built at Thebes,
on the western bank of the Nile. Its twenty-eight lines
contain a song of triumph over the defeat of the Libyans and
their allies from the Greek seas which took place in the fifth
year of the king’s reign. Towards the end the poet sums up
all the glorious deeds of the Pharaoh. ‘The chiefs,’ he says,
‘are overthrown and speak only of peace. None of the
Barbarians (literally, the Nine Bows) lifts up his head.
Wasted (?) is the land of the Libyans; the land of the Hittites
is tranquillised; captive is the land of Canaan and utterly
miserable; carried away is the land of Ashkelon; overpowered is
the land of Gezer; the land of Innuam (in Central Syria) is
brought to nought. The Israelites are spoiled so that they
have no seed, the land of Khar (Southern Palestine) is become
like the widows of Egypt.’</p>

<p class='c003'>Here the Israelites alone are described as without local
habitation. They alone had no ‘land’ in which they dwelt,
and which was called after their name. It would seem, therefore,
that when the song was composed they had already fled
from Egypt and been lost in the unknown recesses of the
eastern desert. But the poet knew that they were of Canaanitish
origin; that they were, in fact, the kinsmen of the Horites
of Southern Palestine. Their misfortunes, consequently, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>equally the misfortunes of ‘Khar,’ whose women had been
made as widows since the male seed of Israel had been cut
off.<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c013'><sup>[158]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>After the fashion of court-poets, the author of the hymn of
victory is not careful about ascribing to his royal master such
successes as he could himself really claim. He has skilfully
combined the victories of Meneptah with those of his father,
and given him the credit of conquests which he had not made.
The Hittites had been ‘tranquillised’ by Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, not by
Meneptah, and Canaan had been the conquest of Ramses and
his father Seti. We may accordingly conclude that in the
case of the Israelites also Meneptah is made to claim what
does not properly belong to him. According to the book of
Exodus, it was the Pharaoh of the Oppression rather than the
Pharaoh of the Exodus who ordered that ‘every son’ should
be ‘cast into the river,’ and only the daughters saved alive.</p>

<p class='c003'>The agreement, however, between the Biblical narrative and
the expression used on the stela of Meneptah is very remarkable.
It is almost as if the writer of Exodus had had the inscription
before him. In both it is the male seed which we
are told was destroyed: the women were left as widows, for all
‘the men children’ were cut off. The victory over the
Israelites, of which the poet boasts, was a victory obtained by
slaying, like Herod, all the children who were males.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nevertheless, ‘the people multiplied.’ It was impossible to
carry out literally the order of the Pharaoh, and there must
have been many children who were saved from death. Among
these was Moses, the future legislator of his race. The story
of his preservation is familiar to every one. We are told how
his mother made ‘an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with
slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and laid it in
the flags by the river’s brink.’ Then the daughter of the
Pharaoh came to bathe, and taking compassion on the child,
brought him up as her own son.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>A similar story had been told centuries before of Sargon of
Akkad, the great Babylonian conqueror and lawgiver. He,
too, it was said, had been placed by his mother ‘in an ark of
reeds, the mouth whereof she closed with pitch,’ and then
launched it on the waters of the Euphrates. The child was
carried to Akki the irrigator, who adopted him as his son, and
brought him up until the day came when, through the help of
the goddess Istar, the true origin and birth of the hero were
made known, and he became one of the mightiest of the
Babylonian kings.</p>

<p class='c003'>A like destiny seemed in store for Moses. He was introduced
into the family of the Pharaoh, and took his place at
court among the royal princes. A punning etymology makes
the princess who adopted him speak Hebrew and give him
the name of Mosheh or Moses, from the Hebrew <span lang="hbo"><i>mâshah</i></span>, ‘to
draw out.’ Mosheh, however, is really the Egyptian <i>messu</i>,
‘son,’ a very appropriate name for an adopted child. The
name was not uncommon in Egypt; and in the time of
Meneptah, the contemporary of Moses, it was actually borne
by a ‘Prince of Kush,’ that is to say, the Egyptian governor
of Ethiopia.<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c013'><sup>[159]</sup></a> The coincidence doubtless was the origin of
that Jewish tradition of the successful campaign of Moses in
Ethiopia as general of the Egyptian army, which is recorded in
full by Josephus.</p>

<p class='c003'>Conjecture, both ancient and modern, has played freely
round the person of Pharaoh’s daughter. Modern writers have
pointed to the fact that the favourite daughter of Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>
bore the Canaanitish name of Bint-Anat, and had been born of a
Syrian mother. That she should have adopted a Hebrew child
would have been nothing strange. Her own sympathies would
naturally have been on the side of her Semitic ancestry.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Moses himself belonged to the tribe of Levi, and future
generations remembered that his father was Amram and his
mother Jochebed. He had a brother Aaron, three years
older than himself, and a sister Miriam. The names of all
three were never forgotten in Israel.<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c013'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Nor did Moses, when he came to man’s estate, forget his
own people. One day, when he was of that unknown age
which the Hebrew writers expressed by the term of forty
years, he saw one of his Israelitish brethren ill-treated by the
Egyptian taskmaster; and with the unrestrained licence of a
young Oriental prince, he forthwith remedied the injustice by
slaying the Egyptian with his own hand. The act was soon
known and discussed among the Hebrew slaves; and when he
endeavoured to reconcile two of them who were quarrelling
with each other, he was told that though he might be ‘a
prince’ in the eyes of the Egyptians, he had no authority over
the Hebrew tribes. The suspicions of the Pharaoh had
already been aroused against him, and he now fled from
Egypt in fear of his life. An Egyptian papyrus, written in the
time of the twelfth dynasty, tells the story of a similar
fugitive from the Pharaoh’s wrath. This was Sinuhit, who
seems to have been accused of conspiring against the government,
and who fled, accordingly, like Moses, alone and on
foot. He made his way to the eastern boundary of Egypt;
and there, when fainting from thirst, was rescued by the Bedâwin
of the desert, and finally reached in safety the land of the
Kadmonites among the mountains of Seir. The shêkh
received him kindly, and Sinuhit in course of time married the
daughter of the Bedâwi chieftain, and became one of the
princes of the tribe. Children were born to him, and he
possessed herds and flocks in abundance. But his heart still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>yearned for his native land; and when in his old age a new
Pharaoh sent messengers to say that his political offences were
forgiven, and that he might return to Egypt, Sinuhit left his
Arab wife and children and went back once more to his own
country.<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c013'><sup>[161]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Like Sinuhit, Moses also fled to the eastern desert, beyond
the reach of the Egyptian power. He did not feel himself
safe till he found himself in Midian. The Sinaitic Peninsula—Mafkat,
as it was called—was an Egyptian province, and
the mines of malachite and copper on its western side
were garrisoned by Egyptian troops. The ‘salt’ desert of
Melukhkha, moreover, which lay between Egypt and Palestine,
was equally under Egyptian control; and, as we learn from the
Tel el-Amarna tablets, supplied contingents to the Pharaoh’s
army.<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c013'><sup>[162]</sup></a> But in Midian Moses was safe from pursuit; and the
‘priest of Midian,’ like the shêkh of Kedem with whom
Sinuhit had to do, gave him a kindly welcome, and married
him to Zipporah, one of his daughters.</p>

<p class='c003'>Government by a priest was a peculiarly Semitic institution.
Assur, the primitive capital of Assyria, had been governed by
high-priests before it had been governed by kings, and so too
had Saba or Sheba in the south of Arabia. There, as we learn
from inscriptions, the Makârib, or High-priests, had preceded
the kings.</p>

<p class='c003'>Tradition has handed down more than one name for the
high-priest of Midian. In one part of the narrative in Exodus
he is called Reuel, in another part Jethro. Jethro is a distinctively
north Arabian name, for which there is monumental
evidence, and it is probably more correct than Reuel.<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c013'><sup>[163]</sup></a> Whatever
may have been his name, however, Moses remained with
him for some time; but instead of being treated like a prince,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>as Sinuhit had been among the Kadmonites, he was set to
keep the flocks of his father-in-law.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was while thus shepherding the flocks of Jethro that
Moses came one day to Horeb, ‘the mountain of God,’ which
rose into the sky at the back of the desert. Here he beheld a
<span lang="hbo"><i>seneh</i></span> or ‘thorn-bush,’ lighted up with fire, which nevertheless
did not consume it.<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c013'><sup>[164]</sup></a> Approaching nearer, he heard a voice
which he believed was that of God Himself, and which told
him that the mountain whereon he stood was holy ground.
Moses was then ordered to return to Egypt, and there in the
name of the God of Israel to command Pharaoh to let His
people go. Wonders and signs were to be performed before
consent would be wrung from the obdurate heart of the
Egyptian king, and ten sore plagues were to be sent upon the
inhabitants of the Delta who had joined with the Pharaoh in
his oppression of the Israelites. At the same time, God
revealed Himself under a new name, which was henceforth to
be that of the national God of Israel. On the slopes of Horeb
the name of Yahveh was first made known to man.<a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c013'><sup>[165]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Moses was met by Aaron ‘in the Mount of God,’ and the two
brothers returned to Egypt together, determined to deliver
Israel from its bondage, and to lead it to that sacred mountain
whereon the name of its national God had been revealed.
Unlike Sinuhit, Moses took with him his Midianitish wife and
the children she had borne him. At this point in the narrative
there has been inserted the fragment of a story which
harmonises but ill with it, or with the general spirit of Old
Testament history. The anthropomorphising legend that
‘the Lord’ met Moses and would have killed him had not
Zipporah appeased the wrathful Deity by circumcising her son,
belongs to the folklore of a people still in a state of crude
barbarism, and is part of a story which enforced the necessity
of circumcision among the Hebrew worshippers of Yahveh.
An over-minute criticism might find a contradiction between
the statement that Zipporah had but one son to circumcise,
and the fact that it was the ‘sons’ of Moses who accompanied
him to Egypt (<abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv.</abbr> 20). Such verbal criticism, however,
is needless; it is sufficient for the historian that the story is a
mere fragment, almost unintelligible as it stands, and in complete
disaccord with the historical setting in which it is placed.</p>

<p class='c003'>Moses and Aaron made their way to the court of the Pharaoh,
and there requested that the Israelites might be allowed to
journey three days into the desert, and hold a feast to their
God. The gods of the Asiatic nomads on the outskirts of
the Delta were gods of the wilderness, whom the Egyptians
identified with Set, the enemy of Horus, the deity of the
cultivated land.<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c013'><sup>[166]</sup></a> The Pharaoh refused the request. Once
lost in the desert, the royal slaves would be lost for ever, and
would never turn back to the line of fortifications which
guarded the eastern frontier of Egypt, and, at the same time,
prevented the escape of those who dwelt within them. The
God of the Hebrews was no god whom the Pharaoh—himself
the offspring and incarnation of the Sun-god—could recognise;
they were the servants of the Egyptian king, and of none else.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>The embassy of the representatives of Israel was followed
by severer measures of repression. It indicated a rising spirit
of rebellion, a desire to return to the old free life of the desert,
and to be quit for ever of Egyptian burdens. Strikes were not
unknown among the free workmen of Thebes; but a strike
among the royal slaves was a more serious matter, and seemed
to prove that the Bedâwi spirit of independence and insubordination
was still active among the settlers in Goshen.<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c013'><sup>[167]</sup></a> The
Israelites were still employed in building cities and fortresses,
and they were now bidden to find for themselves the <span lang="hbo"><i>tibn</i></span> or
chopped straw, which they mixed with the clay of the bricks,
and, at the same time, to deliver the same number of bricks
as before. The <span lang="hbo"><i>tibn</i></span> was employed, as it still is, for binding
the clay more closely together, but it is not essential, and
many of the ancient bricks of Egypt, more especially those
used in Upper Egypt, are made without it. In the Delta,
however, with its damper climate, the <span lang="hbo"><i>tibn</i></span> was more necessary,
and the Egyptian taskmasters, accordingly, required it, or else
some substitute for it.<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c013'><sup>[168]</sup></a> The condition of the Israelites thus
became intolerable; they were scattered over the land, seeking
for ‘stubble instead of straw,’ and beaten mercilessly in
traditional Egyptian fashion if the full tale of bricks was not
delivered. The ‘stubble’ corresponded with the dry stalks
of the durra, which are still sometimes used for a similar
purpose, and was obtained from the beds of dry reeds which
lined the marshes in the Eastern Delta.</p>

<p class='c003'>Once more Moses and Aaron appeared before the Pharaoh,
this time prepared to enforce their petition by signs and
wonders. That they should have had such ready access to
the sovereign may seem strange to the Western mind. But it
is in full accordance with the traditions of the Egyptian court,
which have been maintained down to the reign of the late
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Khedive. The ruler of the country was accessible to all who
had a complaint to make before him, or a petition to offer.
<i>Bakshish</i> might be needful before the charmed circle of
officials by which he was surrounded could be broken through;
but once it was broken, he was bound to give audience to
whosoever came to him. Moses and Aaron, moreover, were
the delegates and representatives of their people, and as such
had a right to be heard. The system they represented is still
in full force in modern Egypt. Each class of the community,
each religion, each trade, each nationality, has its recognised
representative or ‘shêkh,’ who stands between it and the
government, and acts on its behalf in all political and legal
matters. He is as much its representative as an ambassador
or consul is the representative of the nation which has
accredited him, and the rights and privileges which belong to
an ambassador belong also to the ‘shêkh.’ The Pharaoh
could not exclude Moses and Aaron from his presence, even
though the people they represented were public slaves.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Hebrew wonder-workers were confronted by the
magicians of Egypt. Amon-Ra could not yield without a
struggle to the God of the ‘impure’ stranger. The miracles
performed by the representatives of the Israelitish people were
not beyond the powers of his servants, and the magical
powers of the Egyptian priests had been famous from the
beginning of time. The Egyptian had an intense belief in
magic—a belief which still survives in the modern Egypt of
to-day. Books had been compiled which reduced this magic
to a science, and enabled those who would learn its formulæ
and methods to reverse the order of nature and work whatsoever
wonder they desired.<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c013'><sup>[169]</sup></a> To transform a rod into a serpent,
or a serpent into a rod, was a comparatively easy feat, and one
which the jugglers of Cairo can still perform. Equally easy
was it to turn the water of the river into blood, or even to
multiply the frogs on the wet land. It was only when the
plague of lice touched themselves that the power of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>magicians failed, and that they confessed themselves overcome
by a stronger deity than those they owned. Their magic
could not remove the plague which had fallen upon them;
their own garments were defiled in spite of their charms and
amulets, and they had become more unclean than the
‘unclean’ foreigner himself.</p>

<p class='c003'>The account of the ten plagues of Egypt betrays an intimate
acquaintance with the characteristics and peculiarities of the
valley of the Nile. They are all plagues which still recur
there; some of them indeed may be said never to have left
the country. Still, each year, the water of the river becomes
like blood at the time of the inundation. When the Nile
first begins to rise, towards the end of June, the red marl
brought from the mountains of Abyssinia stains it to a dark
colour, which glistens like blood in the light of the setting
sun.<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c013'><sup>[170]</sup></a> Each year, too, the inundation brings with it myriads
of frogs, which swarm along the banks of the river and canals,
and fill the night air with continuous croakings. The lice,
again, are an ever-present plague among the poorer natives,
while every spring the flies still swarm in the houses and open
air, and irritate the visitor to Egypt almost beyond endurance.
Flies and lice, frogs and blood-red water, are all as much a part
of modern Egypt as they were of the Egypt of the Mosaic age.
Natives and strangers alike suffered from them, and that the
plague of flies did not reach to Goshen must have seemed to
the Egyptians a miracle of miracles.</p>

<p class='c003'>Those who have had experience of the flies of Egypt can
sympathise with the Pharaoh when he hastily summoned the
leaders of Israel and bade them offer sacrifice to the God who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>had thus shown himself a veritable ‘Lord of Flies.’ The
plague which followed—the murrain upon the cattle<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c013'><sup>[171]</sup></a>—is of
rarer occurrence, though from time to time it still decimates
the cattle and horses of Egypt. A strict quarantine upon
animals, however, is now enforced at the Asiatic frontier, and
some years, therefore, have elapsed since the last outbreak
of the cattle-plague. But the plague of boils and blains is
still endemic, and residents in the country seldom wholly
escape it. The plague of the thunder and hail is also not
unfrequent; as recently as the spring of 1895 a violent
storm of the kind swept along the valley of the Nile and
destroyed three thousand acres of cultivated land. The
locusts, too, now and again, are carried by the south-east
wind from the shores of the Red Sea to devour the rising
crops, while the darkness that might be felt was but a
heightened form of the darkness occasioned by the <i>khamasin</i>
winds and sand-storms of the spring. Even the death of the
firstborn has its parallel in the epidemic of cholera. In the
space of a single year (1895-1896) the Egypt of our own days
has experienced most of the plagues of which we read in the
book of Exodus. Blood-red water, frogs and lice, flies and
boils, hailstorms and darkness, the scourge of cholera, have
all visited the land.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was nothing, consequently, in the plagues themselves
that was either supernatural or contra-natural. They were
all characteristic of Egypt, and of Egypt alone. They were
signs and wonders, not because they introduced new and
unknown forces into the life of the Egyptians, but because
the diseases and plagues already known to the country were
intensified in action and crowded into a short space of time.
The magicians beheld in them ‘the finger’ of the God of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Hebrews, since they came and went at the command of the
Hebrew leader, and all the magic of Egypt was powerless
before them. Amon-Ra had found a mightier than himself;
and the books of Thoth contained no spells or mystical
incantations which could avail against the scourges that
afflicted priest and layman alike. The reluctant Pharaoh
could no longer resist the cries of his people. Egypt was
perishing, and his own son had died of the plague. It
was better that his cities should remain unfinished than that
there should be none to fill them when they were built.
In the plagues that had descended on them, his subjects saw
the hand of the wrathful Hebrew Deity, eager for the sacrifices
which His people had been prevented from offering to Him
in the desert, and the sceptical Pharaoh himself at last became
a convert to their belief. In fear lest a worse evil might befall
him, he gave the order that the Israelites should be allowed to
pass the fortresses that separated Goshen from the wilderness
beyond, and the royal slaves were free to depart.</p>

<p class='c003'>For how long a time Egypt had thus been stricken by
plague after plague is hard to determine. The impression
left by the narrative is that they followed quickly one upon
the other, and that consequently the period was of no great
length. It is true that the Nile turns ‘red’ in July, and that
the wheat ripens in the spring; but, on the other hand, the
locusts, we are told, eat ‘all that the hail had left.’ At any
rate, it is clear that the Hebrew writer intended us to believe
that less than a year elapsed between the first visit of the
Israelitish representatives to the Pharaoh and the flight into
the wilderness. All was over before the end of March—‘the
first month’ of the Hebrew year.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Egyptian monuments have given us a different version
of the causes which obliged Meneptah to consent to the
exodus of his Asiatic serfs. In the light of the stela discovered
by Professor Petrie at Thebes, we can now understand the
mutilated inscription in which the Pharaoh records on the
walls of Karnak his victory over the barbarians in the fifth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>year of his reign. Lower Egypt and its civilisation were never
nearer to destruction. The Libyans of Northern Africa had
combined with the populations of the Greek Seas, and the
barbarians had overrun the Delta, destroying its cities,
massacring its population, and carrying away its spoil. While
Maraiu, the Libyan king, devastated the eastern banks of the
Nile, his northern allies—the Sardinians and Achæans, the
Lycians and Siculians—landed on the coasts of the Delta, and
marched southward until they joined him.</p>

<p class='c003'>It would seem that they found allies in Egypt itself.
Meneptah tells us that he endeavoured to save what was left
of his dominions by throwing up fortifications in front of
Memphis and Heliopolis, ‘the city of Tum.’ For Egypt was
threatened not only on the west and on the north. Eastward
also, in the land of Goshen, there were enemies, pastoral
nomads from Asia, who had been allowed to live there for
many generations. Their ‘tents,’ the Pharaoh declares, had
been pitched ‘in front of the city of Pi-Bailos,’ the modern
Belbeis, at the western extremity of the region in which the
Israelites were settled. ‘The kings of Lower Egypt’ found
themselves shut up and isolated in their fortified cities, ‘cut
off from everything by the foe, with no mercenaries whom they
could oppose to them.’<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c013'><sup>[172]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>But Meneptah had been ‘crowned to preserve the life’ of
his subjects. In the month of Epiphi, our July, the great battle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>was fought which annihilated the hordes of the invaders and
saved the inhabitants of Egypt. Six thousand three hundred
and sixty-five Libyan slain were counted on the field of battle,
and 2370 of the northern barbarians, while 9376 prisoners
fell into the hands of the conqueror. It was little wonder that
the Egyptian poets composed pæans in honour of the victory,
or that one of these hymns of triumph should have been
engraved on a stela of the temple which Meneptah raised at
Thebes to Amon-Ra.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is in this latter hymn, as has been already said, that the
name of the ‘Israelites’ has been found. They are included
among the enemies over whom the Pharaoh had triumphed;
but, unlike his other enemies, they possessed no land which
they could call their own. They had no fixed habitation,
there was no locality which was called after their name. But
the Egyptian poet knew that they had come originally from
Southern Palestine; the destruction of their male ‘seed’ had
widowed the women of ‘Khar.’</p>

<p class='c003'>It was the pressure of the Libyan invasion, therefore, which
had placed Meneptah at the mercy of his Israelitish slaves.
With the Libyans and their allies in the east and north, and a
hostile population in the land of Goshen, he had been forced
to fortify Memphis and Heliopolis, and to yield to those
demands for freedom which he was not strong enough to
resist. To the ten plagues of which we have the record in
the book of Exodus there was added the more terrible plague
of the Libyan invasion. In his inscription Meneptah speaks
not only of the barbarian enemy who harassed the frontier and
devastated the seaports, but also of the ‘rebels’ who were
destroying the country from within, and in these rebels whose
tents were pitched ‘in front of Pi-Bailos’ we must see the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Israelites of the Old Testament. Crushed and unwarlike
though they may have been, they were nevertheless a source
of danger, and, like Mohammed Ali in the presence of the
Bedâwin, the Pharaoh found it necessary to agree to their
demands.</p>

<p class='c003'>Meneptah’s victory was gained in the middle of the summer.
It was in the spring that the Exodus of the Israelites had
taken place. Along with the descendants of Jacob had gone
‘a mixed multitude,’ fragments, it may be, of that wave of
Libyan invasion which was rolling over the Delta. At any
rate, it was not the Israelites only who had made their way
towards Asia. There were other royal slaves also, like the
‘Apuriu who were employed in drawing the stone that was
quarried on the eastern bank of the Nile. The resemblance
between their name and that of the Hebrews may have led to
a confusion between the brickmakers of Pharaoh and the
transporters of his stone.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was an Egyptian legend of the Israelitish Exodus
which was embodied in the history of Manetho, from whom
it has been quoted by Josephus.<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c013'><sup>[173]</sup></a> The Pharaoh Amenôphis,
it was said, desired to see the gods, as his predecessor Oros
(or Khu-n-Aten) had done. On the advice of the seer,
Amenôphis the son of Paapis, he accordingly cleared the land
of the leprous and ‘impure,’ separating them from the rest of
the Egyptians, to the number of eighty thousand, and condemning
them to work, like the ’Apuriu of the monuments, in
the quarries on the eastern side of the Nile. But among them
were some priests who were under the special protection of
the gods. When the seer heard of the sacrilege that had
been committed against their persons, he prophesied that the
impure people would find allies, and with their help rule over
Egypt for thirteen years. Not daring to tell the king of his
prophecy, he committed it to writing, and then destroyed
himself. After a while the workers in the quarries begged
the Pharaoh to send them to Avaris, the old fortress of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Hyksos, which lay on the Asiatic frontier of Egypt, empty and
uninhabited. The request was granted; but no sooner were
they settled in their new abode than they rose in rebellion,
and chose as their leader Osarsiph, a priest of On. He gave
them new laws, forbidding them, among other things, to revere
the sacred animals, and set them to rebuild the walls of Avaris.
He also sent to the Hyksos at Jerusalem asking them for their
help. A force of two hundred thousand men was accordingly
despatched to Avaris, and this was followed by the invasion
of Egypt. Amenôphis fled to Ethiopia, with the bull Apis
and other holy animals, after ordering the images of the gods
to be concealed. His son Sethos, who was also called
Ramesses, after his grandfather Ramesses the Great, and who
was at the time only five years of age, was placed in charge of a
friend. Amenôphis remained in Ethiopia for thirteen years,
while Osarsiph, who had assumed the name of Moses, and his
Hyksos allies committed innumerable atrocities. Temples
and towns were destroyed, and the priests and sacred animals
were killed. But at last the fated term of years was over;
Amenôphis returned at the head of an army, and the enemy
was utterly overthrown and pursued to the borders of Syria.</p>

<p class='c003'>In this legend truth and fiction have been mingled together.
The foreigner, and more especially the Asiatic foreigner, was
stigmatised as ‘impure’ by the Egyptians, and in the leprous
people who were confined in the quarries of the eastern desert
we must, therefore, see simply a stranger race. Osarsiph
derives his name from Joseph, the latter name being regarded
(as in Psalm <abbr title='eighty-one'>lxxxi.</abbr> 6) as a compound of Yo or Yahveh, which
is identified with the Egyptian Osiris. Amenôphis,<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c013'><sup>[174]</sup></a> the son
of Paapis, is Amenôphis (or rather, Amenôthes), the son of
Hapi who erected the colossal statues of ‘Memnon’ and its
companion at Thebes during the reign of Amenôphis <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>the Pharaoh Amenôphis, the son of Ramesses, and father of
Sethos, is Meneptah, the son of Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, and father of
Seti <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr></p>

<p class='c003'>The return of Amenôphis from Ethiopia was derived from a
sort of Messianic prophecy found already in a papyrus of the
age of Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> Here we read that ‘a king will come
from the South, Ameni the truth-declaring by name. He will
be the son of a woman of Nubia, and will be born in....
He will assume the crown of Upper Egypt, and will lift up the
red crown of Lower Egypt. He will unite the double crown....
The people of the age of the son of man will rejoice and
establish his name for all eternity. They will be far from
evil, and the wicked will humble their mouths for fear of
him. The Asiatics will fall before his blows, and the Libyans
before his flame. The wicked will wait on his judgments, the
rebels on his power. The royal serpent on his brow will
pacify the revolted. A wall shall be built, even that of
the prince, so that the Asiatics may no more enter into
Egypt.’<a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c013'><sup>[175]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>With this prince of ancient prophecy who should save
Egypt from its Asiatic and Libyan foes, it was easy for popular
tradition to identify the Meneptah who had annihilated both
Libyans and Asiatics, and to combine his name with that of
Ameni into the compound Amenôphis. At any rate, the
Egyptian legend bears witness to the fact that Meneptah was
the Pharaoh of the Exodus, and that the flight of the Israelites
was connected with the Libyan invasion of the valley of the
Nile.<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c013'><sup>[176]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>The Israelites themselves connected the flight with the institution
of the feast of the Passover. But the feast of the Passover
seems to have been a combination of two older festivals. One of
these was commemorated by eating for seven days unleavened
bread; the other by the sacrifice of a lamb, the blood of which
was smeared on the doorposts and lintel of the house, the
lamb itself being roasted and eaten at midnight with bitter
herbs. The feast of unleavened bread followed immediately
upon the feast of the Passover, which lasted from the tenth to
the fourteenth day of the first month of the Hebrew sacred
year.</p>

<p class='c003'>Dr. Clay Trumbull has shown that the Passover was but an
adaptation of the old rite which he terms the ‘Threshold
Covenant.’<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c013'><sup>[177]</sup></a> It was a rite which went back to the earliest
age of mankind, and of which we find traces in many parts of
the world. Even in the Egypt of to-day the building of a
new house or boat is not complete without the slaughter of a
sheep, the blood of which is allowed to fall on the threshold
of the house or the deck and side of a vessel. The blood was
the mark of the sacrifice by which the master of the house
entered into covenant with the stranger, or even with his god.
Where it appeared the avenging deity passed by, mindful of
the covenant, and remembering that the house contained a
friend and not an enemy. The threshold became an altar,
and those who passed over it were made members of the
family, and shared with them their rights and their religion.
When once the bride had crossed the threshold of her new
home, she left behind her all her old ties and relations, and
became a member of a new family.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>To quote the words of Dr. Clay Trumbull, ‘Long before’
the night of the Exodus, ‘a covenant welcome was given to a
guest who was to become as one of the family, or to a bride or
bridegroom in marriage, by the outpouring of blood on the
threshold of the door, and by staining the doorway itself with
the blood of the covenant. And now,’ on the eve of the
flight from Goshen, ‘Jehovah announced that He was to visit
Egypt on a designated night, and that those who would
welcome Him should prepare a threshold covenant, or a
passover sacrifice, as a proof of that welcome; for where no
such welcome was made ready for Him by the family, He must
count the threshold as His enemy.’<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c013'><sup>[178]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The belief that sacrifice alone could secure the house from
the wrath of Heaven has been spread widely over the world.
Numberless traces of it are to be found in the folklore of
Europe. Popular legend knows of bridges and castles which
refused to stand until the human victim had been buried
beneath their foundations, and even <abbr title='Saint'>S.</abbr> Columba was held to
have been unable to build his cathedral at Iona until his
companion Oran had been immured alive beneath its foundation-stones.
We learn from the Old Testament that the
belief was strong among the Israelites also. When Hiel of
Beth-el rebuilt the ruined Jericho, we are told that ‘he laid the
foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the
gates thereof in his youngest son Segub’ (1 Kings <abbr title='sixteen'>xvi.</abbr> 34).
The Deity had a right to the firstborn; and if this right were
not recognised by the sacrifice either of the firstborn himself
or of a substitute, there could be no covenant between the
family and its gods. A new building implied a new local
habitation for the family and the gods it worshipped; and
where there was no covenant between them, the gods would
come as foes and not as friends.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Passover feast was therefore nothing new. The rite
connected with it and the ideas associated with the rite must
have long been familiar to the Israelites. What was new was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the adaptation of the rite to the new covenant that Yahveh
was about to enter into with His people. It became ‘the
Lord’s Passover,’ commemorating the deliverance from Egypt
when Yahveh smote the Egyptian firstborn, but ‘passed over
the houses of the children of Israel.’ Like the old springtide
feast of unleavened bread, it was given a new signification,
and made a memorial of the first event in the national life of
Israel. A similar significance was given to a change that was
made in the calendar. The Hebrew year had begun in the
autumn with the month of September; but side by side with
this West-Semitic calendar there had also been in use in
Palestine another calendar, that of Babylonia, according to
which the year began with Nisan or March. It was this
Babylonian calendar which was now introduced for ritual
purposes. While the civil year still began in the autumn, it
was ordained that the sacred year should begin in the spring.
The sacred year was determined by the annual festivals, and
the first of the festivals was henceforth to be the Passover.
The beginning of the new year was henceforth fixed by the
Passover moon.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was at midnight that the angel of death passed over the
land of Egypt. The plague spared neither rich nor poor.
The firstborn of Pharaoh died like the firstborn of the captive
in prison. Vain attempts have been made to discover which
among the sons of Meneptah this may have been. But
Meneptah lived many years after the overthrow of the Libyans,
and consequently after the Exodus of the Israelites, and it may
not have been till late in his reign that his successor, Seti <abbr title='the second'>II.</abbr>,
became crown-prince. More than one elder brother may have
died meanwhile. Moreover, none but the son of a princess of
the royal solar race could sit on the throne of the Pharaohs.
The reigning king might have elder sons born to him by
foreign princesses, but his successor could not be chosen from
among them. He only who could trace his descent to the
Sun-god, who was, in short, a direct descendant of the Pharaohs,
had any right to the throne.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Amid the terrors of the plague, and under cover of the
darkness, the Israelites and their companions, the ‘mixed
multitude,’ departed from the land of Goshen. They took
with them their flocks and herds; they took also such precious
plunder as they could easily carry away from the houses of
their terrified masters. They ‘borrowed,’ according to the
euphemistic expression of the chronicler, ‘jewels of silver and
jewels of gold, and raiment,’ ‘and they spoiled the Egyptians.’
It was little wonder that the Pharaoh subsequently determined
to pursue the retreating hordes.</p>

<p class='c003'>They first made their way from ‘Rameses to Succoth.’
Succoth is the Thukut of the Egyptian texts, the district in
which Pithom was situated, and which extended from the land
of Goshen to the line of fortifications that enclosed Egypt on
the East. It is mentioned in the letter sent to Meneptah
three years after the Israelitish Exodus, which we have already
had occasion to quote.<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c013'><sup>[179]</sup></a> The flight of the Israelites had left
the district uninhabited, and it was not very long before it was
again handed over to some of their Edomite kinsmen, who
wanted pasture for their herds.</p>

<p class='c003'>The site of the town of Rameses is still uncertain. It is
called Pi-Ramses, ‘the House of Ramses,’ in the hieroglyphic
texts, and, like Zoan, it lay near the canal of Pa-shet-Hor. A
long description is given of it by the scribe Paebpasa, who
was stationed at Zaru, on the eastern frontier of Egypt, during
the early part of Meneptah’s reign. He tells us (according to
Brugsch’s translation)<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c013'><sup>[180]</sup></a> how he had ‘arrived at the city of
Ramses and found it excellent, for nothing can compare with
it on the Theban land and soil.... Its canals are rich in
fish, its lakes swarm with birds, its meadows are green with
vegetables, there is no end of the lentils; melons with a taste
like honey grow in the irrigated fields. Its barns are full
of wheat and durra, and reach as high as heaven....
The canal, Pa-shet-Hor, produces salt, the lake-region of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Pa-Hirnatron. Their sea-ships enter the harbour, plenty and
abundance is abundant in it.’ And then the scribe goes on to
describe the annual festivities of its inhabitants in honour of
their founder Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr></p>

<p class='c003'>In Thukut or Succoth were fortresses which protected the
Delta from Asiatic incursions, and at the same time prevented
those who were in Egypt from escaping out of it without the
permission of the Government. One of them was called ‘the
Khetem,’ or ‘Fortress, of Thukut’; another the Khetem of
Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> Both seem to be mentioned in a report sent to
Meneptah’s successor, Seti <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> Here we read: ‘I set out
from the hall of the royal palace (in Zoan) on the 9th day
of the month Epiphi, in the evening, after the two (fugitive)
slaves. I arrived at the Khetem of Thukut on the <abbr title='tenth'>10th</abbr> of
Epiphi. I was informed that the men had resolved to take
their way towards the south. On the <abbr title='twelfth'>12th</abbr> I reached the
Khetem. There I was informed that grooms who had come
from the neighbourhood [had reported] that the fugitives had
already passed the Wall to the north of the Migdol of king
Seti Meneptah.’<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c013'><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The runaway slaves must have taken the same road as that
which had been taken by the Israelites before them. The
Israelites had avoided the nearest and more usual road to
Palestine, which ran along the edge of the Mediterranean and
passed through Gaza. The Philistines were already threatening
the southern coast of Canaan, and Gaza was garrisoned
by Egyptian troops. The undisciplined and unwarlike multitude
which followed Moses would have been cut to pieces
had they ventured to force their way through them, or else
would have returned to Egypt. They turned therefore southward
towards the desert and ‘the way of the wilderness of the
Yâm Sûph.’</p>

<p class='c003'>From Succoth, we are told, they marched to Etham ‘in the
edge of the wilderness.’ Brugsch was the first to see that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Etham we have a Hebrew transcription of the Egyptian
Khetem. The only question is, which of the many Khetemu
or ‘Fortresses’ which protected the Asiatic frontier of Egypt
this particular Etham may have been. We hear of ‘the
Khetem of Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, which is in the district of Zaru,’ at
the very point where one of the roads to Asia passed through
the great line of fortification, and the report quoted above
tells us of another Khetem, that of Thukut. It was, however,
the second Khetem mentioned in the report which is referred
to in the Old Testament narrative. This second Khetem lay
between Succoth and the lines of fortification, and might
therefore be described as ‘in the edge of the wilderness,’ which
began on the eastern side of the Shur or fortified wall. It
was, in fact, the fortress which guarded one of the roads out of
Egypt at the point where it intersected the lines. To the
south of it came the Migdol or Tower of King Meneptah.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is possible that this may be the Migdol which is stated
in the book of Exodus to have been near the next camping-place
of the Israelites. From the fortress of Etham they had
turned to the ‘sea,’ and had there pitched their tents ‘before
Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon.’
In Baal-zephon, ‘Baal of the North,’ we have the
name of a Phœnician temple, which is alluded to in an
Egyptian papyrus;<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c013'><sup>[182]</sup></a> and in place of Pi-hahiroth, the Septuagint
and Coptic versions read ‘the farmstead,’ reminding us of the
<i>ahu</i> or ‘estate’ of Pharaoh in the district of Thukut, on which
the Edomite herdsmen were afterwards allowed to settle.</p>

<p class='c003'>But what is ‘the sea,’ by the side of which the Israelites
encamped? Its identification has been the subject of much
controversy—a fact, however, which ceases to astonish us
when we find that the Hebrew writers themselves were uncertain
about it. While in the narrative of the Exodus ‘the
sea’ crossed by the Israelites is carefully distinguished from
the ‘Yâm Sûph’ or ‘Reedy Sea,’ at which they subsequently
arrived, there are other passages in the Old Testament,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>more especially of a poetical nature, in which the two seas
are confounded together. Two irreconcileable systems of
geography are thus presented to us which have hitherto made
the geography of the Exodus an insoluble problem.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the narrative, however, all is clear and exact. The
children of Israel, it was determined, instead of following the
northern road to Palestine, should march along that which led
to ‘the wilderness of the Yâm Sûph.’ But between them and
this wilderness lay the Egyptian wall of fortification, which
extended from the marshes in the north to the Gulf of Suez,
or its prolongation, in the south. It was only when they had
turned the southern end of the wall by crossing ‘the sea’
that they entered ‘the wilderness of the wall,’ where they
wandered for three days without finding water (<abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 22).
Later they came to the palm-grove of Elim, and then after
that to the Yâm Sûph (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-three'>xxxiii.</abbr> 10).</p>

<p class='c003'>The Yâm Sûph was well known to Hebrew geography, and
corresponded with the modern Gulf of Aqaba. It was upon
the Yâm Sûph, at Elath and Ezion-geber, ‘in the land of
Edom,’ that Solomon built his ships (1 Kings <abbr title='nine'>ix.</abbr> 26); and after
the capture of Arad, in the extreme south of Canaan, the
Israelites marched ‘from mount Hor by the way of Yâm Sûph,
in order to compass the land of Edom’ (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 4). Elim
is but another form of Elath, the ruins of which lie close to
Aqaba, while the town of Sûph lay ‘over against’ the wilderness
in the plains of Moab (<abbr title='Deuteronomy'>Deut.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 1). The Yâm Sûph, in
fact, so erroneously rendered ‘the Red Sea’ in the Authorised
Version, was the Gulf of Aqaba. The sister Gulf of Suez
was called by the Hebrews ‘the Egyptian Sea’ (Isa. xi. 15), a
very appropriate name, since it was enclosed on either side
by Egyptian territory. From the days of the third dynasty to
those of the Ptolemies, Mafkat, the Sinaitic peninsula, was
included among the provinces of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the list of the Israelitish stations given in <abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-three'>xxxiii.</abbr>
a careful distinction is made between the Yâm Sûph (<abbr title='verse'>ver.</abbr> 10)
and ‘the sea,’ through the midst of which the fugitives from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Pharaoh passed safely into the wilderness. This ‘sea’ washed
the southern extremity of the Shur or ‘Wall’ of fortification,
the line of which was approximately that of the Suez Canal.
If Dr. Naville is right, in the days of the Exodus it would have
extended much further to the north than is at present the
case; the Bitter Lakes, in fact, marking its northern boundary.
But there are serious difficulties in the way of this hypothesis.
The canal which, in the time of Seti <abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr>, already united the
Pelusiac arm of the Nile with the Gulf of Suez, ran southward
as far as the modern town of Suez, where its mouth can still
be traced. Only five miles north of Suez, moreover, the
fragments of a stela can still be seen, on which Darius commemorated
his reopening of the old canal of the Pharaohs.
Had the gulf really extended so far north as Ismailîya and
the Bitter Lakes, this southern prolongation of the canal would
be hard to understand.</p>

<p class='c003'>However this may be, the poets and later writers of the
Old Testament came to forget what was meant by ‘the sea.’
It was confounded with the Yâm Sûph, and the scene of the
Exodus was accordingly transferred from the Gulf of Suez to
the Gulf of Aqaba. Dr. Winckler has recently endeavoured
to show that besides Muzri or Egypt, the Assyrian inscriptions
know of another Muzri or ‘borderland’ in the north-west of
Arabia. If so, this second Muzri or Egypt might help to
explain the confusion between the two seas.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is in the song of triumph over the destruction of the
Egyptians that the confusion first makes its appearance. Here
(<abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 4) ‘the sea’ and ‘the Yâm Sûph’ are used as equivalents,
and the contents of the song are summed up at the end
in the statement that ‘Moses brought Israel from the Yâm
Sûph.’ But elsewhere in the Pentateuch the geography is
accurate, and it is not until we come to the speeches in the
book of Joshua that the two seas are once more confused
together.<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c013'><sup>[183]</sup></a> The same geographical error is repeated in two
of the later Psalms, as well as in a passage of the book of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Nehemiah.<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c013'><sup>[184]</sup></a> The older Hebrew geography had by this time
been forgotten; with the loss of Edom and its seaports an
exact knowledge of the two arms of the Red Sea had faded
from the memories of the Jews. But in the historical narrative
of the Pentateuch all is still distinct and clear.</p>

<p class='c003'>Hardly had the Israelites left Goshen before the Pharaoh
repented of his permission for their departure. The retreating
multitude, encumbered with women and children, with flocks
and herds, and with the booty that had been carried off from
the Egyptians, was still encamped within the lines of fortification,
near the southernmost Migdol or ‘Tower,’ and on the
shores of ‘the sea.’ Southward was a waterless desert; behind
were the hostile forces of Egypt. The situation seemed hopeless;
‘the wilderness,’ as the Pharaoh said, had ‘shut them
in,’ and there seemed no escape from the Egyptian troops
which had now been sent in pursuit of them.</p>

<p class='c003'>But Israel was saved, as it were, by miracle. All night long
the sky was black with clouds, while a strong east wind drove
the shallow waters of ‘the sea’ before it towards the western
bank. The fugitives marched in haste through its dried-up
bed, and before morning dawned they had reached the eastern
shore. The Egyptian forces pursued, but it was too late.
The wheels of the chariots sank into the soft sand, and before
they could advance far the wind dropped and the waters
returned upon them. The chariots and host of Pharaoh were
overwhelmed by the flowing tide.</p>

<p class='c003'>Classical history knew of similar events. Diodoros (<abbr title='sixteen'>xvi.</abbr> 46)
tells us that when Artaxerxes of Persia led his forces against
Egypt, part of his army perished, swallowed up in the ‘gulfs’
of the Sirbonian Lake on the Mediterranean Sea. Alexander’s
troops, moreover, narrowly escaped being swallowed up by
the waters of the Pamphylian Gulf, through which they
passed during the winter, and their escape was magnified by
later writers into a miracle.<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c013'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>The Pharaoh was not himself among the six hundred chariots
which had pursued the flying Israelites into ‘the sea.’<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c013'><sup>[186]</sup></a> As in
the great battle against the Libyans, Meneptah, while taking
the field in person, nevertheless took care to avoid actual
danger and to delegate his authority to others when there was
a prospect of fighting. He lived several years after the Libyan
victory, and therefore after the Israelitish Exodus; and though
his tomb in the Bibân el-Molûk at Thebes was never finished,
he was buried in it at a ripe old age. A dirge,<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c013'><sup>[187]</sup></a> probably
composed at the time of his death, speaks of the king as
dying at an advanced period of life.</p>

<p class='c003'>With the waters of ‘the sea’ between themselves and Egypt,
the Israelites felt that they were at last free men. The fortified
wall of Egypt was behind them; they were already in the
desert-home of their Asiatic kinsmen, free to move whithersoever
they desired. But there was one road which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>could not take. If the fear of ‘seeing war’ had kept them
back from the northern road to Palestine, it would still more
keep them from the road which led into the Egyptian province
of Mafkat. Here on the western side of the Sinaitic peninsula
were the mines of copper and malachite worked by
Egyptian convicts, and strongly garrisoned by Egyptian troops.
To venture near them would have been to court again the
danger from which the fugitives had just escaped.<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c013'><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The road was well known. For centuries it had been
trodden by Egyptian troops and miners, by civil officials and
the convicts of whom they had charge. There was no
difficulty, therefore, in avoiding it, and in plunging instead
into the desert which led to their kinsfolk in Edom and that
land of Canaan which was their ultimate goal.</p>

<p class='c003'>Old errors die hard, and the belief that the Sinaitic peninsula
was the scene of the wanderings of the Israelites still
prevails among students of the Old Testament. It originated
in the wish of the early Christian anchorites in the Sinaitic
peninsula to find the localities of the Pentateuch in their own
neighbourhood, and has been fostered by the geographical
confusion between ‘the sea’ crossed by the Israelites and the
Yâm Sûph. But the belief is not only irreconcileable with
the facts of Egyptian history, it is also irreconcileable with the
narrative of the Pentateuch itself. It transports the Amalekites
or Bedâwin of the desert south of Judah to the western side
of the Sinaitic peninsula, and performs the same feat for the
wilderness of Paran.<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c013'><sup>[189]</sup></a> It makes Jethro, the high-priest of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Midian, cross the Gulf of Aqaba and make his way through
barren gorges and hostile tribes in order to visit his son-in-law,
and sets at defiance the express testimony of Hebrew
literature that Mount Sinai was among the mountains of Seir.<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c013'><sup>[190]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The wilderness into which the Israelites emerged is called
indifferently that of Shur and Etham. Shur was the Semitic
equivalent of the Egyptian Anbu or ‘Wall’ of fortification,
while Etham took its name from one of the Khetemu or
‘Fortresses’ which guarded the approach to the valley of the
Nile. It was a wilderness which stretched away to the shores
of the Gulf of Aqaba, and the Hebrew tribes accordingly
marched along it. They took, we are told, ‘the way of the
wilderness of the Yâm Sûph,’ following the Haj road, which is
still traversed by the pilgrims from Egypt to Mecca. But the
caravan moved slowly, and for three days they could find no
water. Had they turned southward into the Sinaitic peninsula,
a few hours would have brought them to the Wells of
Moses—now a place of picnic for the visitors to Suez,—while
the road to the Egyptian mines was provided with cisterns
and wells. But to have done so would have been merely to
exchange Egypt for one of its strongly-garrisoned provinces.</p>

<p class='c003'>How long the wanderers were in crossing the desert we do
not know; nor do we know where Marah was, whose ‘bitter’
waters refreshed them after three days of scarcity. But at
last they reached the oasis of Elim, which the itinerary in the
book of Numbers (<abbr title='thirty-three'>xxxiii.</abbr> 10) couples with the Yâm Sûph.
Elim, in fact, is but a variant form of Elath,<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c013'><sup>[191]</sup></a> and Elath is the
Aila of classical geography, of which Aqaba is the modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>successor. When the Israelites left Elim a whole month had
elapsed since their departure from Egypt (<abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='sixteen'>xvi.</abbr> 1).</p>

<p class='c003'>Between Elim or the Yâm Sûph<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c013'><sup>[192]</sup></a> and Mount Sinai lay the
Wilderness of Sin. Sinai and Sin alike derived their names
from Sin, the moon-god of Babylonia, whose worship had
long since been brought by Babylonian conquest to the West.
More than two thousand years before the Exodus the Babylonian
conqueror, Naram-Sin, ‘the beloved of Sin,’ had carried
his arms as far as the Sinaitic peninsula, and the inscriptions of
Southern Arabia show that there also the Babylonian deity
was adored.<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c013'><sup>[193]</sup></a> It would seem probable that a temple dedicated
to his service stood on the slopes of Mount Sinai.</p>

<p class='c003'>Numerous attempts have been made to identify the mountain
which the Israelites regarded as the scene of the first
pronouncement of their Law. Most of these attempts are
based on the belief that it is to be sought in the Sinaitic
peninsula. The rival claims of Jebel el-’Ejmeh, Jebel Umm
’Alawî, Jebel Zebîr-Katarîna, Jebel Serbâl, and Jebel Mûsa
have all been eagerly discussed. Jebel Mûsa alone can claim
the support of tradition, though this does not go back further
than the third or fourth century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr>, when the Christian
hermits first settled in its neighbourhood. The Sinai of
<abbr title='Saint'>S.</abbr> Paul and Josephus was still in the Arabia of Roman
geography, the kingdom of which Petra was the capital.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the geography of the Old Testament, however, Mount
Sinai was in Edom. This is expressly stated in the Song of
Deborah, one of the oldest products of Hebrew literature.
Here we read (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v.</abbr> 4, 5), ‘Lord, when Thou wentest out
of Seir, when Thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the
earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also
dropped water. The mountains melted from before the Lord,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>even that Sinai from before the Lord God of Israel.’ Similar
testimony is borne by the blessing of Moses (<abbr title='Deuteronomy'>Deut.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-three'>xxxiii.</abbr> 2),
‘The Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them;
He shined forth from the Mount of Paran,’ an expression
which appears in another form in Habakkuk (<abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 3), ‘God
came from Teman, and the Holy One from the Mount of
Paran.’ Teman denoted Southern Edom, and Paran was the
desert which adjoined Edom on the west and Judah on the
south, and in whose midst was the sanctuary of Kadesh-barnea.<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c013'><sup>[194]</sup></a>
In the Blessing of Moses the parallelism of Hebrew
poetry requires that Sinai and Seir should be equivalent
terms.</p>

<p class='c003'>We must, then, look to the frontiers of Edom and the
desert of Paran for the real Sinai of Hebrew history. But it
is useless to seek for a more exact localisation until the
mountains of Seir and the old kingdom of Edom have been
explored. Then, if ever, the Sinai of the Pentateuch may be
discovered. It would seem that it formed part of a range
that was known as ‘Horeb,’ the ‘desert’ mountains, and as
late as the age of Elijah it was still reverenced as ‘the Mount
of God’ (1 Kings <abbr title='nineteen'>xix.</abbr> 8).<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c013'><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Before the Israelites actually reached the sacred mountain,
they had to make more than one encampment in ‘the Wilderness
of Sin.’ The itinerary in the book of Numbers gives
the names of three—Dophkah, Alush, and Rephidim—the
narrative mentions only the last. Rephidim, the ‘Encampments,’
was the scene of the first conflict the Israelites were
called upon to face. Here they were attacked by the Amalekites,
the Bedâwin tribes who still consider the desert as
their own, and whose hand is against all that pass through it.
The attack was repulsed, but not without loss, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>remembrance of it never faded from the minds of the Hebrew
people. There was henceforth to be war between Amalek
and Israel ‘from generation to generation,’ until the Bedâwin
marauders of the desert should be destroyed. The Song of
Deborah (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v.</abbr> 14) tells us how the struggle was continued
after the settlement in Canaan, and the first Israelitish king
did his utmost to root out these pests of the Hebrew borderland.
Saul smote them, it is said, from Havilah to Shur
(1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 7), from the ‘sandy’ desert of Arabia Petræa to
the great Wall of Egypt. And the Hebrew writer expressly
adds that these were the same Amalekites as those who had
lain in wait for Israel ‘in the way when he came up from
Egypt.’ There were no Amalekites in the Sinaitic peninsula;
the desert in which they ranged was that which adjoined
Edom, and was known to the ancient Babylonians as the
‘land of Melukhkha.’ Hence it was that Edomites and
Amalekites were mingled together, and that Amalek was
counted by the genealogists a grandson of Esau.</p>

<p class='c003'>The battle at Rephidim was followed by the visit of the
father-in-law of Moses, Jethro, ‘the priest of Midian.’ The
visit was natural, for the real Sinai lay on the frontier of
Midian. It was while Moses was feeding the flock of Jethro
that he had first come to it and received his commission from
Yahveh. Here, therefore, at ‘the Mount of God,’ he was
within hail of his old home.</p>

<p class='c003'>Jethro’s visit marked the first step in the organisation of
Israel. Under his guidance and counsel judges of various
grades were appointed before whom minor cases could be
brought, and each of whom was invested with a certain
amount of power. The functions of the ‘judge’ were administrative
and executive as well as legal; what was meant
by the term we may learn from the book of Judges as well as
from the Shophetim or judges who at one time took the
place of the kings at Tyre. They corresponded closely with
the higher officials in the Turkish provinces, who possess an
undefined and in some respects absolute authority, subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>only to the official who is immediately above them. The
‘judges’ established by Moses on Jethro’s advice derived
their titles from the numerical extent of their jurisdiction.
They were judges ‘of thousands,’ ‘of hundreds,’ ‘of fifties,’
and ‘of tens.’ The community was divided into ideal units,
of larger and smaller size, the basis of the arrangement being
the decimal system. The whole arrangement may have been
of Midianite origin; at all events, in the Assyrian texts we
hear also of a ‘captain of fifty’ and a ‘captain of ten.’<a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c013'><sup>[196]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Moses remained the supreme ‘judge’ and lawgiver of his
people. To him alone all ‘great matters’ were referred, and
from him came all the laws and ordinances, the rules and
regulations which they were called upon to obey. The leader
who had brought them safely out of ‘the house of bondage’
now became their recognised head and legislator. Moses
‘was king in Jeshurun,’ exercising all the authority in Israel
which in later times belonged to the king.</p>

<p class='c003'>Hardly was the political organisation of the new community
completed before the Israelitish tribes reached the venerated
sanctuary of Sinai, and encamped before ‘the Mount of God.’
The first object of their journey was accomplished, and the
promise of Yahveh was fulfilled that they should ‘serve God’
on the mountain where He had appeared to their leader.
Here at Sinai the earlier portion of the Mosaic legislation
was promulgated. It was subsequently supplemented by the
legislation at Kadesh-Barnea, that second resting-place of the
tribes, where by the side of En-Mishpat, ‘the Spring of
Judgment,’ they prepared themselves in the security of the
heart of the desert for the future invasion of Canaan.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was amid the terrors of a thunderstorm that Yahveh
declared His laws to the people of Israel. While darkness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>rested on the summit of the mountain, broken only by the
flashes of the lightning and the voice of the thunder, ‘the
Ten Words’ were delivered to man. In their forefront stood
that stern, uncompromising declaration of monotheism which
henceforth marked the religion of Israel. They began with
the commandment that Israel should have ‘no other gods
before’ the Lord. Yahveh had brought them forth from
Egypt, and Yahveh only must they therefore serve. The commands
which followed were partly general, partly applicable
to the Israelites alone. The prohibition to make ‘the likeness
of any thing in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in
the water under the earth,’ defined the character of the God
before whom no other was to be worshipped. He had no
form or attributes which could be represented by art; it was
the gods of the Gentiles only of whom images or pictures
could be made. Egypt had been a land of idols, and in
leaving Egypt Yahveh required that the idols also should be
left behind. In the simple life of the desert there was no place
for art: here man was alone with his Creator, who revealed
Himself in the light of the burning bush or the thunderings
of the storm, not under the forms of the creatures He had
made. The second commandment was part of the teaching
which the wanderings in the desert were intended to enforce;
and if Israel was to remain a ‘peculiar people,’ dedicated to
the service of Yahveh, and secure from absorption into the
nations that surrounded it, it was necessary that it should be
fenced about with a law of puritanical strictness, which forbade
the introduction of art under any shape. Art in the world of
the Exodus was too closely interwoven with the religions of
Egypt and Canaan and Babylonia to be other than a forbidden
thing. The subsequent history of Israel proved how wise
and needful had been the prohibition. The art which adorned
the temple and palace of Solomon was followed by the
erection of altars to the divinities of the heathen, and even
in the wilderness the golden calf was worshipped in sight of
Sinai itself.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>The third and fourth commandments were, like the second,
Israelitish rather than general in character. The third forbade
taking in vain the name of Yahveh; the name of the national
God of Israel which had been so specially revealed was too
sacred to be lightly spoken of. The ‘name’ of Yahveh, in
fact, was equivalent to Yahveh Himself, and to deal lightly with
the name was to deal lightly with One of whose essence it was.
The obligation to keep the Sabbath was part of the culture
which Western Asia had received from Babylonia. Among
the Babylonians the Sabbath had been observed from early
times, and the institution seems to have gone back to a pre-Semitic
period. At all events, it was denoted in Sumerian by a
term which a cuneiform tablet explains as ‘a day of rest for the
heart,’ and its Assyrian name of Sabattu or ‘Sabbath’ was even
derived by the native etymologists from the two Sumerian words
<i>sa</i>, ‘a heart,’ and <i>bat</i>, ‘to rest.’<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c013'><sup>[197]</sup></a> In Babylonia and Assyria, as
in Israel, the Sabbath was observed every seventh day, perhaps
in accordance with the astronomical system which dedicated
the seven days of the week to the seven planets of Babylonian
science. These seven-day weeks, however, were based on the
lunar months of the Babylonian year, the Sabbath or rest-day
being on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th of each month. There
was, moreover, another Sabbath on the 19th of the month, that
being the end of the seventh week from the first day of the
preceding month. On these Sabbath days work of all kinds
was forbidden to be performed. The king, it was laid down,
‘must not eat flesh that has been cooked over the coals or in
the smoke, must not change the garments of his body, must
not wear white clothing, must not offer sacrifices, must not ride
in a chariot, must not issue royal decrees.’ Even the diviner
was not allowed to ‘mutter incantations in a secret place.’
Nor was it permitted to take medicine.</p>

<p class='c003'>With the other elements of Babylonian culture the institution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>of the Sabbath had made its way to the West. But at Sinai
it was given a new and special application. Not only was
it to be observed each seventh day of the week, irrespective of
the beginning of the month, it became also a sign and mark
of the covenant between Israel and its national God. In the
book of Exodus, it is true, the reason given for keeping it is
that Yahveh had rested on the seventh day from His work of
creation—a reason which will hardly be accepted by the
geologist—but in Deuteronomy (<abbr title='five'>v.</abbr> 15) it is more fittingly
brought into direct connection with the deliverance from
Egypt: ‘Remember that thou wast a servant in the land of
Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence
through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore
the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath
day.’</p>

<p class='c003'>The sanction of the fifth commandment is also one which
applied to Israel alone: children were enjoined to honour
their parents that their days might be long in the land which
Yahveh had promised to give them. But the last five commandments
are of general application, and accordingly no
reason is given for keeping them derived from the accidents of
Hebrew history. They apply to all mankind, at all times and
in all parts of the world. Murder, adultery, theft, false witness,
and covetousness are all crimes forbidden everywhere by the
legal or moral code. But it is strange that lying and deceit
are not included among them; in this respect the so-called
negative confession, which the soul of the dead Egyptian was
called upon to make in the next world, was more complete.<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c013'><sup>[198]</sup></a>
The lie, however, which does not involve false witness is apt
to be condoned among the nations of the East.</p>

<p class='c003'>The ten commandments were followed by a series of other
laws, many of which were probably re-enactments of laws or
regulations already in force. The law of retaliation, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>instance (<abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 23-25), is as old as human society; so also
is the law that murder should be punished by death (<abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 12).
The law which punished the master for the murder of a slave
if he died on the spot, but allowed him to go scot-free if the
slave lingered for a day or two (<abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 20, 21), had its parallel in
ancient Babylonia, and the death-penalty exacted from the ox
which had gored a man (<abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 28-32) is a survival from the days
when dumb animals and even inanimate objects were regarded
as responsible for the injuries they had caused.<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c013'><sup>[199]</sup></a> The regulations
in regard to ‘a field or vineyard,’ or ‘the standing corn’
of a field (<abbr title='twenty-two'>xxii.</abbr> 5, 6), belonged to the land of Goshen or to
Canaan, not to the life in the wilderness, and the dedication
of the firstborn to God (<abbr title='twenty-two'>xxii.</abbr> 29, 30) was one of the most
ancient articles of Semitic faith.</p>

<p class='c003'>Equally applicable to Egypt or Canaan only are the
injunctions to let the land lie fallow every seventh year (<abbr title='twenty-three'>xxiii.</abbr>
11), and to celebrate the three great feasts of the year
(<abbr title='twenty-three'>xxiii.</abbr> 14-19). They were all feasts of the agriculturist rather
than of the pastoral nomad. The year was ushered in with
the spring festival of unleavened bread; then in the summer
came the feast of harvest, and finally in the autumn—‘the
end’ of the old civil year—the feast of the ingathering of the
fruits.</p>

<p class='c003'>Such were some of the laws promulgated under the shadow
of the sacred mountain, when Israel first encamped before
Mount Sinai. They concluded with an exhortation to march
against Canaan. Yahveh declared that He would send His
Angel before His people to guide them in their way, like the
<i>sukkalli</i> or ‘angels’ of the Babylonian gods. Yahveh would
fight for them, and they should drive out the older inhabitants
of the land and take their place. They were in no wise to
mingle with them or worship their gods; like the idolaters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>themselves, the idols they adored were to be destroyed. ‘From
the Yâm Sûph to the sea of the Philistines and from the desert
to the river’ were to be the bounds of their new home, a
promise which was fulfilled in the kingdom of David.<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c013'><sup>[200]</sup></a> That,
too, extended to ‘the river’ Euphrates, and included the land
of Edom with its two ports on the Yâm Sûph. ‘The sea of
the Philistines’ is a new name for the Mediterranean, and
bears testimony to the maritime fame those pirates from the
north had already acquired.<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c013'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The laws thus promulgated at Sinai became the first code
of Israel. They rested on the covenant that had been made
between Yahveh and His people, of which the first clause was
that they should worship none other gods but Him. The
book in which they were written by Moses was accordingly
called the Book of the Covenant, and its words were read
aloud to the assembled multitude (<abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-four'>xxiv.</abbr> 7). The audience,
it must be remembered, included not the Israelites only, but
the ‘mixed multitude’ as well (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='eleven'>xi.</abbr> 4).</p>

<p class='c003'>Once more Moses ascended the sacred mountain, to learn
the ‘pattern’ of the tabernacle in which Yahveh was henceforth
to be worshipped. It was to be a tent, moving along with the
people, and containing all the objects of Israelitish veneration.
Chief among these was the ark of the Covenant, surmounted
by the mercy-seat and its two cherubim, between which
Yahveh sat enthroned when He revealed Himself to His
worshippers. Babylonia also had its arks, its mercy-seats, and
its cherubim, and Nebuchadrezzar speaks of ‘the seat of the
oracles’ in the great temple of Babylon ‘whereon at the
festival of Zagmuku, the beginning of the year, on the 8th and
11th days, Bel, the god, seats himself, while the gods of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>heaven and earth reverently regard him, standing before him
with bowed heads.’<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c013'><sup>[202]</sup></a> The cherubim, indeed, were of Babylonian
origin, and their presence in the tabernacle seems
somewhat inconsistent with the prohibition to make a carven
image. But the Israelites were the heirs of the ancient culture
of Western Asia, and the tabernacle and its furniture embodied
familiar forms of architecture and older religious conceptions.</p>

<p class='c003'>In Egypt, too, the gods had their shrines, though these were
usually boats which on the days of festival floated over the
sacred lakes. Arks, however, were not unknown, and, as in
Babylonia, contained the images of the gods. Sometimes,
however, in Babylonia and Assyria, the ark, like that of Israel,
had no image within it: the stone coffer, for instance, found
by Mr. Hormuzd Rassam in the inner sanctuary of the little
temple of Balawât contained two tables of alabaster on which
the annals of king Assur-nazir-pal were engraved. The native
workmen who discovered them naturally saw in them the two
tables of stone which had been similarly placed by Moses in
the ark (<abbr title='Deuteronomy'>Deut.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'>x.</abbr> 5).<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c013'><sup>[203]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The parallelism between the temples and ritual of Israel and
of Babylonia is indeed close. The temple itself was of the
same square or rectangular form. Outwardly it presented the
appearance of a huge box. Within were the forecourt and
court, while at the back came the Holy of Holies, with its
altar and ark. There was, however, one distinguishing feature
in the Babylonian temple which was lacking in the Hebrew
tabernacle. That was the great tower which mounted up
towards heaven, and the topmost stage of which seemed to
approach the gods. In the absence of a tower the Hebrew
tabernacle agreed with the temples of Canaan.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Israelitish altars found their counterpart in Babylonia.
So, too, did the table of shewbread, which similarly stood in
the sanctuaries of the Chaldæan deities. The sacrifices and
offerings were also similar. Babylonia had its daily sacrifice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>its ‘meal-offering,’ and its offerings for sin; the same animals
that were sacrificed to Yahveh were sacrificed also to Bel; and
the Babylonian worshipper sought the favour of his gods with
the same birds and the same fruits of the field. Oil, moreover,
was used for purposes of anointing, and herein the ritual of
Babylonia and Israel differed from that of Egypt, where oil was
not employed.<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c013'><sup>[204]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The contrast between Egypt and Israel, indeed, in the
details of religious service was as great as the agreement in
this respect between Israel and Babylonia. The children of
Israel had never forgotten their Asiatic origin; throughout
their long sojourn in Goshen they had preserved their old
culture and habits of thought as tenaciously as they had
preserved their language. Between them and the Egyptians,
on the contrary, there had been antagonism from the outset.
And this antagonism was accentuated by their lawgiver, who
was naturally anxious to turn their thoughts from ‘the fleshpots
of Egypt,’ and to prevent them from lapsing into Egyptian
idolatries. Even the Egyptian legend of the Exodus bears
witness to this fact.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>In one detail, however, we find an analogy in Egypt.
Professor Hommel<a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c013'><sup>[205]</sup></a> has pointed out that the breastplate of
the high-priest, the mysterious Urim and Thummim, with its
twelve engraved stones, is pictured on the breast of an
Egyptian priest. Thus Seker-Khâbau, a high-priest of
Memphis in the age of the nineteenth dynasty, wears upon his
breast a sort of double network with four rows of precious
stones set in it, each row consisting of three stones, alternately
in the form of crosses and disks.<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c013'><sup>[206]</sup></a> The Hebrew breastplate
was used as an oracle, like the linen ephod which was worn
under it, though how the future was divined from it we do
not know. But in moments of danger it was usual to consult
it; and the fact that ‘when Saul inquired of the Lord, the
Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor
by prophets,’ is brought forward as a proof that he had been
forsaken by his God (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-eight'>xxviii.</abbr> 6). Like the lawgiver
himself, it was the mouthpiece of Yahveh, and as such it bore
the name of ‘the breastplate of judgment.’</p>

<p class='c003'>The architects of the tabernacle and its adornment in
precious metals were Bezaleel of Judah and Aholiab of Dan.<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c013'><sup>[207]</sup></a>
Modern criticism would hold them to be part of an elaborate
fiction, of which the tabernacle was the subject. But the
fiction would be too elaborate, too detailed, to be conceivable.
Moreover, we have references to the tabernacle or ‘tent of
meeting’ in the later history of Israel; and to declare these to
be interpolations or the products of the same pen as that
which invented the tabernacle itself may be an easy way of
saving a theory, but it is not scientific. How far the description
of the tabernacle is exact, how far it has not been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>coloured by the conceptions of a later age, is, of course, a
question that may be asked. Those who maintain that the
Pentateuch goes back in substance to the Mosaic age must
nevertheless allow that it has undergone many changes and
modifications before assuming its present shape. But, except
in rare instances, it is impossible to indicate these changes
with the assurance that the historian demands, and we must
therefore be content with the probability that in the description
of the tabernacle we have the revised version of an
old story.</p>

<p class='c003'>It has been asked how the materials used in the construction
of the tabernacle could have been obtained in the desert,
from whence came the silver and gold, the bronze and precious
stones, the rich embroideries and cloths stained with Tyrian
dye? Those who ask such questions have forgotten that the
Israelites were not wild Bedâwin, and that they were laden
with the spoils of Egypt. Like the invading hosts who
attacked Egypt in the reign of Ramses <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>, they carried with
them in their retreat the treasures of their late masters. And
we are specially told that the gold was obtained from the
bracelets and earrings and rings which were offered by the
people and melted down.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was during the second absence of Moses, when the conception
and form of the tabernacle were being revealed to his
mental vision, that his followers showed how little they understood
the spirit and character of the legislation he was
endeavouring to give them. They believed he had deserted
them, and with his departure his religious teaching departed
also. Israelitish religion was no slow growth: like Zoroastrianism
or Buddhism or Christianity itself, it implies an
individual founder who gave it the impress of his own
individuality. Modern theories which attempt to explain it as
a process of evolution start with a false assumption, and arrive
consequently at false conclusions. None of the great religions
of the world has been a product of evolution except in an
indirect sense; they are all stamped with individualism, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>owe their existence to the genius or inspiration of an individual.
The religions of Babylonia and Egypt, as far as we know, were
the results of a slow development; but Mosaism and Zoroastrianism,
Buddhism and Christianity derived not only their
names, but their essence also from the individual founders who
created them. We cannot understand the religion of Israel
without the Law in its background, and we cannot understand
the Law without the personality of its lawgiver.</p>

<p class='c003'>The declaration that Israel should serve no other gods
before Yahveh stood or fell with Moses, to whom Yahveh had
revealed Himself. And Moses seemed to have vanished
among the clouds that enveloped the summit of the sacred
mountain. Their leader and his God had deserted them, and
the people required another. Aaron the priest was ready to
take the place of the lost lawgiver, and to provide them with
a new deity and a new faith. And, after all, it was but an
ancient faith, the faith of the kindred nations that surrounded
them, their own faith, moreover, in the days before the
Exodus. A calf was fashioned out of their golden earrings,
and in it both priest and people beheld the god who had
brought them out of Egypt. Aaron proclaimed a feast in
honour of the divinity whose worship was celebrated with the
same shameless rites as those which characterised the cult of
the Semitic populations of Babylonia, of Canaan, and of
Arabia.</p>

<p class='c003'>But in the midst of the festival Moses suddenly reappeared.
The sons of Levi rallied round their tribesman, and fell with
him upon the rebels against his laws. Some of the latter were
slain, the rest were terrorised, and the golden calf was ground
to powder.<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c013'><sup>[208]</sup></a> Aaron was forgiven, perhaps because he too had
gone over to the side of Moses, perhaps because he was too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>powerful or too necessary to be removed.<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c013'><sup>[209]</sup></a> But in his wrath
at the defection of his people Moses had dashed to the ground
the two stone tables on which the words of God had been
written, and it was needful that they should be replaced.
Once more, therefore, Moses left the camp and sought solitary
communion with Yahveh on the summit of Sinai. Two fresh
tables of stone were hewn, and with these he ascended the
mountain.</p>

<p class='c003'>We must not picture to ourselves heavy stelæ of stone such
as the kings and princes of Egypt delighted to set up in their
tombs and temples, or the ‘great slab’ which Isaiah was
bidden to engrave (<abbr title='Isaiah'>Isa.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 1). They were rather like the
small alabaster slabs found in the ark of the Assyrian temple
at Balawât, which measure only twelve and a half inches in
length by eight in width and two and a half inches in thickness,
and nevertheless contain a long and valuable text. They
were, in fact, stone tablets cut in imitation of the clay tablets
which served as books in the Asiatic world of the Exodus,
and, like the latter, were probably inscribed with cuneiform
characters. That these characters were used for ‘the language
of Canaan’ we know from the existence of two seals of the age
of the Tel el-Amarna correspondence, now in the possession
of <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> de Clercq, which record the names of two Sidonians.<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c013'><sup>[210]</sup></a>
It is probable that the first draft of the Ten Commandments
was also in the cuneiform script.</p>

<p class='c003'>The book of Exodus ends fitly with the conclusion of the
legislation which was promulgated from Mount Sinai and
with the building of the tabernacle. Henceforward Yahveh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>was to reveal Himself to His people, not amid the clouds of
a mountain in the wilderness, but in the sanctuary which they
had raised in His honour. The first stage in the education of
Israel had been completed; the Israelites had become a
nation with a national God and a national sanctuary. Henceforth
the sanctuary was to be the centre of their religious
faith, the place where the law and judgment of God were to
be declared, and to which the tribes were to resort that they
might ask counsel from Him. The tabernacle, nomad though
it still was, like the tribes themselves, had taken the place of
‘the mount of God,’ and with the legislation of Leviticus a
new book of the Pentateuch begins.</p>

<p class='c003'>We are not to suppose that this legislation has descended
to us from the age of Moses without addition and change.
Such a belief would be contrary to the history of other
religious law-books, or indeed to historical probability. As
the utterances of the Hebrew prophets were modified or
enlarged according to the circumstances of the successive
ages to which they were applied, so too the Mosaic legislation
must have undergone revision and enlargement. Laws and
regulations which suited the life in the desert needed adaptation
to the changed conditions of life in Canaan; tribes fresh
from their servitude in Egypt required different guidance from
that required by a nation of conquerors; and the details of a
legislation which was adapted to the period of Moses would
have been wholly unsuited to the period of the Judges, and
still more to the period of the Kings. So far as the change
and modifications are concerned, which all institutions in this
world must necessarily undergo, the Mosaic legislation was a
matter of growth. But it was the form and details that
changed, not the substance of the legislation. The spirit and
conceptions of the legislator had imprinted themselves too
indelibly upon it ever to be obliterated. The reiteration of
the same law in various forms, and the confused arrangement
of many of them, may indeed show that later hands have been
at work, but in essence and origin they remain his. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>book of Leviticus, modernised though it may be, nevertheless
goes back to the age of Moses.</p>

<p class='c003'>Even in the age of Moses many of its regulations were not
new. We find their parallels in Babylonia and Canaan, and
they had doubtless long been among the unwritten institutions
of Israel. But Moses gave them a new sanction and a new
adaptation. The Israelites must have had priests like the
nations round about them; but it was Moses who defined the
priestly character of the sons of Aaron, and consecrated his
own tribe to the service of Yahveh. If Yahveh was the national
God of Israel, He was also in a special way the tribal God of
Levi.</p>

<p class='c003'>We still know too little about the details of Babylonian
ritual to be able to compare it with the religious institutions
of Israel. We know, however, that the peace-offerings and
trespass-offerings of the Mosaic Law were represented in it,
that even the heave-offerings found in it their counterpart,
and that solemn fasts and days of atonement were observed
in Babylonia and Assyria as well as among the Israelites. In
Babylonia, too, a distinction was made between clean and
unclean animals, and, as in Israel (<abbr title='Leviticus'>Lev.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 17-23), none who
was maimed or diseased was allowed to minister to the gods.
Purification with water, moreover, played much the same part
in Babylonian ritual that it played in the ritual of the Israelites,
and tithes were exacted for the support of the service in the
temples.</p>

<p class='c003'>Similar regulations prevailed in Canaan, as we may learn
from the Phœnician sacrificial tariffs found at Carthage and
Marseilles. Both are mutilated, but the missing portions of
the one can to a large extent be supplied from the other.
The text thus obtained is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c003'>‘In the temple of Baal the following tariff of offerings shall

the son of Bod-Tanit, the son of Bod-Ashmun, and in
the time of Halzi-Baal, the judge, the son of Bod-Ashmun the

the priests shall receive ten shekels of silver for each beast,
and if it be a full-offering, the priests shall receive besides
this three hundred shekels’ weight of flesh. And for a prayer-offering
they shall receive besides the small joints (?) and the
roast (?), but the skin and the haunches and the feet and the
rest of the flesh shall belong to the offerer. For a bullock
which has horns, but is not yet broken in and made to serve,
or for a ram, as a full-offering, whether it be a prayer-offering
or a full thank-offering, the priests shall receive five shekels of
silver for each beast, and if it be a full-offering they shall
receive besides this one hundred and fifty shekels’ weight of
flesh; and for a prayer-offering the small joints (?) and the
roast, but the skin and the haunches and the feet and the rest
of the flesh shall belong to the offerer. For a sheep or a goat
as a full-offering, whether it be a prayer-offering or a full
thank-offering, the priests shall receive one shekel of silver
and two <i>zar</i> for each beast; and in the case of a prayer-offering
they shall have besides this the small joints (?) and
the roast (?), but the skin and the haunches and the feet and
the rest of the flesh shall belong to the offerer. For a lamb
or a kid or a fawn as a full-offering, whether it be a prayer-offering
or a full thank-offering, the priests shall receive three-fourths
of a shekel of silver and two <i>zar</i> for each beast; and
in the case of a prayer-offering they shall have besides this the
small joints (?) and the roast (?), but the skin and the haunches
and the feet and the rest of the flesh shall belong to the offerer.
For a bird, whether wild or tame, as a full-offering, whether it
be <i>shetseph</i> or <i>khazuth</i>, the priests shall receive three-fourths
of a shekel of silver and two <i>zar</i> for each bird, and [a certain
amount of flesh besides]. For a bird, or for the offering of
the firstborn of an animal, or for a meal-offering, or for an
offering with oil, the priests shall receive ten pieces of gold
for each.... In the case of every prayer-offering which is
offered to the gods, the priests shall receive the small joints (?)
and the roast (?); and the prayer-offering ... for a cake and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>for milk and for fat, and for every offering which is offered
without blood.... For every offering which is brought by a
poor man in cattle or birds, the priests shall receive nothing....
Anything leprous or scabby or lean is forbidden, and no
one as regards that which he offers shall taste of the blood of
the dead. The tariff for each offering shall be according to
that which is prescribed in this publication.... As for every
offering which is not prescribed in this table, and which is not
made according to the regulations which have been published
in the time of ...-Baal the son of Bod-Tanit, and of Bod-Ashmun
the son of Halzi-Baal, and of their comrades, every
priest who accepts the offering which is not included in that
which is prescribed in this table shall be punished.... As
for the property of the offerer who does not discharge his debt
for his offering [it shall be taken from him].’<a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c013'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The general resemblances between these regulations and
those of the Levitical law are obvious. In both we have the
same kind of sacrifices and offerings—the ox, the sheep and
the goat, the lamb and kid, birds and cakes, meal and oil.
Silver shekels were to be paid to the priests, like the silver
shekels of the sanctuary exacted in certain cases from the
Israelite (<abbr title='Leviticus'>Lev.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v.</abbr> 15, <abbr title='twenty-seven'>xxvii.</abbr> 25), and the blood and the fat
were to be offered to the gods. The necessities of the poor
man were remembered as they were in the Levitical law
(<abbr title='Leviticus'>Lev.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v.</abbr> 7, <abbr title='twelve'>xii.</abbr> 8, <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 21), and whatever was ‘leprous or
scabby or lean’ was forbidden to be brought to the altar.
The firstborn could be claimed by Baal as they were claimed
by Yahveh, and the offerer was not permitted to taste of the
blood of the slain beast (compare <abbr title='Leviticus'>Lev.</abbr> <abbr title='seven'>vii.</abbr> 26, 27). The
‘full-offerings’ of the Phœnician tariffs mean that the whole
of the victim had been given to the gods, and so correspond
with the burnt sacrifices of the Mosaic Code. It is unfortunate
that we cannot fix with certainty the exact signification
of the words denoting the parts of the animal which were the
due of the priests, and consequently cannot be sure whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>or not they answer to the breast and shoulder of the peace-offering,
which under the Levitical legislation were assigned
to the sons of Aaron (<abbr title='Leviticus'>Lev.</abbr> <abbr title='seven'>vii.</abbr> 33, 34).</p>

<p class='c003'>It is true that the tariffs of Carthage and Marseilles belong
to a late period. But they embody regulations and usages
which were common to the Semitic world of Western Asia, as
we may gather from a comparison of them with the ritual of
Babylonia, and which therefore must have been—at least in
substance—of great antiquity. Two conclusions result from
this fact. On the one hand the Levitical legislation cannot
have been the invention of the Exilic age, as some adventurous
critics have believed; on the other hand, it is based on
customs and ideas which must have been prevalent in Israel
long before the birth of Moses. The Hebrew legislator did
but develop, modify, and define existing rites; the Levitical
Code is not a new creation, but a body of religious and ritual
laws which has been formed deliberately and with individual
effort out of older customs and habits of thought. Doubtless
there are laws and regulations which were the immediate
creation of the lawgiver; from time to time new cases arose
for which special legislation was needed, and of which the
cases of Nadab and Abihu (<abbr title='Leviticus'>Lev.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'>x.</abbr> 1-3), of the son of
Shelomith and the Egyptian (<abbr title='Leviticus'>Lev.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-four'>xxiv.</abbr> 10-16), and of the
daughters of Zelophehad (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-seven'>xxvii.</abbr> 1-11) are examples.
To assume that such cases originated in the laws which they
illustrated, and not the reverse, is a gratuitous supposition
which is contradicted by the history of modern European law.<a id='r212'></a><a href='#f212' class='c013'><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Whether the Day of Atonement, the Feast of Trumpets on
the first of each seventh month and the Year of Jubilee were
also new creations of the lawgiver, may be questioned. The
special legislation connected with them, as well as their
association with the Exodus out of Egypt, was certainly
peculiar to the Levitical code, but the same is true of the
three older feasts of the Semitic calendar. These too were
made to illustrate the events of Israelitish history, and new
regulations were laid down for their observance. The Day of
Atonement, however, had its counterpart in Babylonia and
Assyria. There also in periods of danger or distress, days of
humiliation and fasting were prescribed, and prayers and offerings
were made to the gods that they might forgive the sins of
the people. When at the beginning of Esar-haddon’s reign
Assyria was threatened by the Kimmerian invasion, ‘religious
ordinances and holy days’ were proclaimed by the priests for
‘a hundred days and a hundred nights,’ and the sun-god was
besought to remove the sin of his worshippers.<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c013'><sup>[213]</sup></a> So, again,
after the suppression of the Babylonian revolt, Assur-bani-pal
tells us that ‘by the command of the prophets I purified their
sanctuaries and cleaned their streets which had been defiled.
Their wrathful gods and angry goddesses I tranquillised with
prayers and penitential hymns. Their daily sacrifice, which
had been discontinued, I restored in peace and established
again as it had been before.’ The Feast of Trumpets reminds
us that in Babylonia the first day of each month was kept as a
Sabbath, and the Babylonian analogy is still more manifest
in the case of the Feast of Pentecost, on ‘the morrow after
the seventh Sabbath,’ after the offering of the firstfruits. This
‘seventh Sabbath’ is the Babylonian Sabbath, on the 19th of
the month, forty-nine days after the first Sabbath of the preceding
month. The Year of Jubilee was a Babylonian institution
of exceeding antiquity. We learn from classical
writers<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c013'><sup>[214]</sup></a> that once each year in the month of July the feast of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Sakea was held at Babylon, when the slave changed places
with his master, and for five days lived and was clothed as a
free man. We can now carry the history of the institution
back to the age of the third dynasty of Ur. Gudea, the high-priest
of Lagas, <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 2700, states in his inscriptions that after
he had finished building the temple of E-ninnu, he celebrated
a festival; and ‘for seven days no obedience was exacted; the
female slave became the equal of her mistress, and the male
slave the equal of his master; the subject became the equal of
the chief; and all that was evil was removed from the temple.’<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c013'><sup>[215]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The Year of Jubilee, it is clear, was but an adaptation and
improvement of one of the oldest institutions of Babylonian
culture. To assert that, together with the other holy days of
the Levitical Code, it was borrowed from Babylonia in the age
of the Exile, is to assert what not only cannot be proved, but is
in the highest degree improbable. In the age of the Exile,
Babylonia had become a second Egypt to the Jews, and the
religious party among them regarded with abhorrence all that
was specifically Babylonian. The feasts consecrated to ‘Bel
and Nebo,’ the rites associated with the worship of the Babylonian
gods, were the last things that would be adopted or
adapted by a pious Jew. Moreover, we now know that the
culture which had been carried from Chaldæa to the west long
before the period of the Exodus included the gods and sacred
rites of the Babylonians. So distinctive a characteristic of it
as ‘the feast of Sakea,’ or days of prayer and humiliation for
‘the removal of sin,’ would not be forgotten when Anu and
Moloch and Ashtoreth and Nin-ip made their way to Canaan.</p>

<p class='c003'>There are passages in the Levitical Code which look back
very distinctly to Egypt. Thus marriage with a sister, whether
a full sister or a half-sister, is forbidden (<abbr title='Leviticus'>Lev.</abbr> <abbr title='eighteen'>xviii.</abbr> 9). This
was one of ‘the doings of the land of Egypt’ (<abbr title='Leviticus'>Lev.</abbr> <abbr title='eighteen'>xviii.</abbr> 3)
which had been consecrated there both by the civil and by the
religious law, and continued in force down to the time of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Roman conquest. So, too, tattooing the flesh, and shaving
the head or lacerating the flesh for the dead, were prohibited
(<abbr title='Leviticus'>Lev.</abbr> <abbr title='nineteen'>xix.</abbr> 27, 28, <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 5), all of them practices which are still
common in the valley of the Nile. But, on the whole, it is
remarkable how entirely Egypt is ignored. The Mosaic legislation
seems intentionally to close its eyes to all things Egyptian,
and, wherever it is possible, to make enactments which tacitly
contradict or set aside the beliefs and customs of Egypt. Even
the doctrine of the resurrection, as Bishop Warburton long ago
observed, is carefully dropped out of sight. There is no reference
to it, no sign that obedience to the laws of Yahveh will
benefit the Israelite in any other world than this. On any
theory of the age and authorship of the Levitical law such a
silence is remarkable. Indeed, if the law is as late as the
epoch of the Babylonish exile the silence would be more than
remarkable, since the doctrine of a future life and of the
power of the god Merodach to raise the dead to life had been
firmly established for centuries among the Babylonians. A
belief in the resurrection, or at all events, in a life beyond the
grave, could not but have betrayed itself in the atmosphere of
the Exile. For those, however, who had the Egyptian house
of bondage immediately behind them, and who feared lest the
tribes in the desert might again lust after the flesh-pots and
green pastures of the Delta, the silence is intelligible. The
doctrine was closely associated with Egyptian idolatry, with
Osiris and Anubis, with the assessors of the dead, and with
the pictured polytheism of the Egyptian monuments.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Levitical legislation was accompanied by a census of
the people. What credit we are to attach to the numbers
which have been handed down is a question that has been
much debated. On the one hand it has been shown that the
vast multitude presupposed by them could not have moved
about in the desert, as it is represented to have done, and that
many of the regulations in the Levitical Code could not have
been carried out with a nomad population of over two millions.<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c013'><sup>[216]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>On the other hand, the 600,000 men above twenty years of
age who were ‘able to go forth to war’ are specified again and
again, and the same number is implied in all the calculations
that are made of the numerical strength of Israel. It is also
the sum of the numbers assigned to the fighting men of the
individual tribes. Throughout the history the ciphers are
consistent with one another. If the number is exaggerated, it
it is an exaggeration which has been consistently adhered to.
We must either accept it, or believe that it belongs to an
artificial system which has been framed with deliberate intention.
But the same may be said of the chronology of the early
patriarchs as well as of the chronology of the kings of Israel
and Judah, and in both instances we know that the system is
wrong. In the case of the chronology of the early patriarchs,
indeed, there are at least three rival systems, all equally complete
and self-coherent, while the chronology of the kings
involves such hopeless anachronisms as have long since caused
it to be rejected by the historian. The difficulties presented
by the census of the Israelites in the wilderness are similar in
character to the anachronisms presented by the chronology of
the kings, and the same reasons which lead us to reject the
one ought equally to induce us to reject the other.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nevertheless, the chronology of the kings is not wholly incorrect.
The length of reign assigned to the several kings is
usually right. It is only the system into which it has been
fitted that is at fault. And probably this is also the case as
regards the numbering of the tribes of Israel. It may be that
the 8580 Levites and the 22,273 firstborn males are authentic,
and that the increase of the population by 3550 (<abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-eight'>xxxviii.</abbr>
26; <abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 46) a few months after the flight from Egypt,
and its decrease by 1820 at the end of the wanderings (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr>
<abbr title='twenty-six'>xxvi.</abbr> 51), rest on a foundation of fact. Even the traditional
number of 600,000 may have better support than its being a
multiple of the Babylonian <i>soss</i> and <i>ner</i>.<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c013'><sup>[217]</sup></a> Perhaps it originally
represented the whole body of fugitives from Egypt.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>At all events, some light may be thrown on the matter by a
comparison of the numbers given in the Pentateuch with those
of the Libyans and their allies as recorded in the inscription of
Meneptah. Of the Libyans, 6365 men were slain and 230
(including 12 women) were captured; of their allies, 2370 fell
on the field of battle, and 9146 were taken prisoners, while no
less than 9111 bronze swords were taken from the Maxyes.
We gather from the history of the battle that few, if any, of
the enemy escaped. The whole force of fighting men, therefore,
would not have amounted to very much over 25,000.
And yet this was one of the most formidable hosts that had
invaded Egypt; and its male population had not been decimated
by the tyranny of an Egyptian king. On the other
hand, a population of 2,000,000 in the land of Goshen is inconceivable,
and there would hardly have been room in the
eastern Delta for 600,000 able-bodied brickmakers. The
Sweet-water Canal was dug by only 25,000 fellahin, though
250,000 worked at the Mahmudîya Canal, and for some years
20,000 fresh labourers were sent monthly to excavate the Suez
Canal. Even in the desert, moreover, the Egyptians required
a considerable number of troops to guard the serfs or convicts
who worked for them. At Hammamât, for example, in the
reign of Ramses <abbr title='the fourth'><span class='fss'>IV.</span></abbr>, the 2000 bondservants of the temples
who effected the transport of the stone were attended by 5000
soldiers, 800 mercenaries, and 200 officers; and provisions for
this large body of men were carried across the desert in ten
waggons, each drawn by six pairs of oxen, and laden with bread,
meat, and cakes.<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c013'><sup>[218]</sup></a> For 600,000 Israelites the whole Egyptian
army would not have sufficed. According to Manetho, the
Hyksos, when driven from Egypt, did not number more than
240,000 in all.</p>

<p class='c003'>We cannot, then, look upon the numbers that have come
down to us as exact. The occupants of the Israelitish camp,
continually under the personal supervision of Moses, and constantly
required to assemble before the tabernacle, could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>have been a very large body of men. Had the fighting population
amounted to anything like the number recorded, there
would have been no need of avoiding ‘the way of the land of
the Philistines,’ lest the people should ‘see war,’ or of doubting
the issue of the combat at Rephidim with the Bedâwin
tribes.</p>

<p class='c003'>The year after the flight from Egypt, Sinai, ‘the mount of
God,’ was left behind. The service that Yahveh required had
been performed, the legislation revealed there had been completed,
and the tabernacle and ark had been made. Israel
had henceforth another religious centre than the sacred
mountain of the desert, which had now fulfilled its part in the
religious training of the tribes. Canaan, and not the wilderness,
was the destined home of the descendants of Jacob, and
to Canaan the ark and the tabernacle were to accompany
them.</p>

<p class='c003'>The guiding column of cloud moved accordingly from the
wilderness of Sinai to that of Paran (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'>x.</abbr> 12). This
is in harmony with the rest of Old Testament geography. In
the blessing of Moses (<abbr title='Deuteronomy'>Deut.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-three'>xxxiii.</abbr> 2) it is said that when God
came from Sinai, ‘He shined forth from the mount of Paran,’
and in Habakkuk (<abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 3) the mount of Paran takes the place
of Sinai itself. Paran, in fact, was the desert which formed
not only the southern boundary of Canaan, but also the
western frontier of Edom. The real Mount Sinai of Hebrew
geography, therefore, was upon the Edomite border; and since
Paran was the home of Ishmael (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 21), it is not
surprising that Esau should have taken one of Ishmael’s
daughters to wife (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-six'>xxxvi.</abbr> 3).</p>

<p class='c003'>Before Sinai was left, however, Hobab the Midianite, the
brother-in-law of Moses, proposed to return to his own land.
Sinai adjoined Midian, if indeed it was not included in
Midianitish territory, and here, therefore, if at all, it was
needful for the Midianite chief to quit the Israelitish camp.
But his knowledge of the district was too valuable to be lost,
and Moses persuaded him to remain with the Israelitish tribes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>and guide them to the places where they should encamp.
The Kenites in later days traced their descent to him (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr>
16, <abbr title='four'>iv.</abbr> 11), and the rocky nest of the Kenites was visible from
the heights of Moab, perhaps in Petra itself (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-four'>xxiv.</abbr> 21).</p>

<p class='c003'>The geographical details which follow are confused. In the
itinerary (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-three'>xxxiii.</abbr> 15, 16) the camp is transported at
once from the wilderness of Sinai to Kibroth-hattaavah. In
the narrative, however, we are told that the people first went
‘three days’ journey,’ and then rested at Taberah, which
seems to be identified with Kibroth-hattaavah; from thence
they travelled to Hazeroth, and then pitched their tents ‘in
the wilderness of Paran.’ On the other hand, the book of
Deuteronomy (<abbr title='nine'>ix.</abbr> 22) distinguishes between Taberah and
Kibroth-hattaavah, and interpolates Massah between them,
which, according to <abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='seventeen'>xvii.</abbr> 7, was visited before Sinai.
If we follow the official record, we must suppose that the
incident connected with Taberah has been inserted in the
wrong place, or else that Taberah and Kibroth-hattaavah are,
like Massah and Meribah, one and the same. At all events,
all these encampments must have lain on the outskirts of the
desert of Paran. Hazeroth, ‘the enclosures,’ was a common
name for the Bedâwin encampments in the desert south of
Judah, and the Hazeroth mentioned here is doubtless that of
which we read in <abbr title='Deuteronomy'>Deut.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 1. It lay near Paran on the borders
of the plains of Moab.</p>

<p class='c003'>Taberah, it was said, derived its name from the fire which
had here consumed some of the people, while Kibroth-hattaavah
marked the ‘graves’ of the murmurers who had
died from a surfeit of quails. Similar flights of quails still
visit the Egyptian Delta in the early spring, when the sky is
sometimes overshadowed by myriads of birds. Hazeroth was
remembered for the rebellion of Aaron and Miriam against
their brother Moses, and the punishment that Miriam the
prophetess had in consequence to endure. The authority of
Moses was disputed because he had married an Ethiopian
wife. It is the only passage in the Pentateuch where this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>‘Cushite’ wife is alluded to; elsewhere we hear only of
Zipporah the Midianitess. But it points to a traditional recollection
of the days when Moses was still Messu, the Egyptian
prince, and when, like that other Messu, his contemporary, he
might have been the Egyptian governor of Ethiopia.<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c013'><sup>[219]</sup></a> The
objection to the Ethiopian wife came but ill from Aaron,
whose grandson bore the Egyptian name of Phinehas,
Pi-nehasi, ‘the negro.’ But Yahveh declared that the Cushite
affinities of Moses were no bar to his being a true servant of
the God of Israel and the divinely-appointed leader of the
tribes. To him Yahveh had revealed His will openly, and as
it were face to face; not, as to other prophets, in waking
visions and dreams.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the heart of the wilderness of Paran was the venerable
sanctuary of Kadesh-barnea. Centuries before, the army of
Chedor-laomer had swept through it, slaughtering its Amalekite
inhabitants, and drinking the water of En-Mishpat, ‘the Spring
of Judgment,’ where the shêkhs of the desert had given laws
to their people. Its site has been found again in our own days
by Dr. John Rowlands and Dr. Clay Trumbull.<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c013'><sup>[220]</sup></a> The spring
of clear water which fills the oasis with life and verdure is still
called ’Ain Qadîs, the ‘Spring of Kadesh.’ It rises at the
foot of a limestone cliff, in which a two-chambered tomb has
been cut in early times, in the hollow of an amphitheatre
of hills. The hills form a block of mountains which occupy
the central part of the desert, midway between El-Arîsh and
Mount Hor, and more than forty miles to the south of Sebaita,
the supposed site of Hormah.</p>

<p class='c003'>Kadesh, the ‘Sanctuary,’ was destined to be the second
resting-place and scene of Israelitish legislation. The work
which had been left unfinished at Sinai was completed here.
The will of Yahveh, which had first been declared on the
summit of the mountain, was now to be more fully unfolded
among the soft surroundings of the oasis in the valley. Sinai
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>and Kadesh-barnea were the two schools of the desert in which
Israel was trained.</p>

<p class='c003'>But Kadesh-barnea had other advantages as well. It was
on the high-road from the desert to Canaan, it commanded
the approach to the latter country, and nevertheless within its
rocky barriers the Israelites were safe from attack. Here,
therefore, at Kadesh-barnea, the first preparations were made
for the invasion of Palestine. Twelve scouts were sent, in
Egyptian fashion, to explore the land, and bring back a report
of its capabilities for defence. They made their way as far as
Hebron,<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c013'><sup>[221]</sup></a> where a popular etymology derived the name of the
valley of Eshcol from the cluster of grapes they had cut there.<a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c013'><sup>[222]</sup></a>
But the report with which they returned was discouraging.
The Amorites were tall and strong; by their side the children
of Israel appeared but as grasshoppers; while the cities in
which they dwelt were ‘very great,’ and walled, as it were, to
heaven. It was folly for the desert tribes to dream of assaulting
them; that would need the disciplined army of a Pharaoh,
with its chariots and horses and machines for scaling the walls.
‘We be not able to go up against the people,’ they declared,
‘for they are stronger than we.’</p>

<p class='c003'>Here, then, was an end to all the promises of Moses. The
Promised Land was in sight, and they were excluded from it
for ever. ‘Let us make another captain,’ they cried, ‘and
return to Egypt.’ The leader who had brought them thus far
had failed on the very threshold of their goal. The Hyksos,
when they forsook Egypt, had found a refuge in Canaan; but
the barren wastes of the wilderness were all that the Israelites
could expect. It was little wonder that a rebellion broke out
in the Israelitish camp, and that the supporters of Moses were
threatened with stoning.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>But experience soon showed that the Israelitish tribes were
as yet no match for the people whose possessions they desired
to seize. Despite the report of the spies, they climbed the
cliff which formed the northern boundary of the oasis, and
attempted to force their way beyond the frontiers of Canaan.
But their enemies proved the stronger. When Seti <abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> had
attacked the frontier fortress of Canaan, not far from Hebron,
he had found it defended by Shasu or Bedâwin, and so, too,
the Israelites now found themselves confronted not by the
Canaanites only, but also by their Amalekite or Bedâwin allies.
The assailants were utterly defeated and ‘discomfited even
unto Hormah.’</p>

<p class='c003'>Hormah was more usually known as Zephath (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 17),
and its site must be looked for south of Tell ’Arad. It was
one of the cities of Palestine which Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> claims to
have captured, and it lay towards the southern end of the Dead
Sea, on the road to Hazezon Tamar (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 7). The
mention of it makes it clear that the Israelitish invasion of
Canaan had been a serious attempt. The invaders had
marched along the same military road as that followed by
Chedor-laomer, and had penetrated as far as the hill country
of what was afterwards Judah. But they did not succeed in
getting further, and their shattered relics must have made their
way with difficulty back to the fastness of Kadesh. The first
attempt to conquer Palestine had failed.<a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c013'><sup>[223]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The disaster was never forgotten. It was some years before
the Israelites again attempted to cross the Canaanitish boundary,
and when they did so it was from a different quarter. A new
generation had to grow up before they were strong enough to
renew the attack; indeed, it is probable that most of the
fighting men had been lost in the earlier expedition. When
at last Israel felt able once more to march against Canaan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>it was already in possession of land on the east of the Jordan,
but its great ‘captain’ and lawgiver was dead. Israelitish
history found its leader to the conquest of Palestine not in
Moses, but in Joshua.</p>

<p class='c003'>The history of the period that followed the disaster left little
that was worth recording. The chief incidents of the life in
the desert had been crowded into the first few months of the
wanderings. But it was during this later period that trouble
arose with Moses’ own tribesmen, the Levites. It was again
a question of authority. The democratic spirit of the Israelites
resented claims to superior power; and just as Aaron and
Miriam had disputed the authority of Moses, so now the Levites
disputed that of Aaron. It was a dispute which, if we are to
believe modern criticism, was continued into later Jewish
history, when it ended, as it did in the desert, in the triumph
of the high-priest.</p>

<p class='c003'>Aaron and his sons, like Moses, were at the outset Levites,
and as such doubtless had no claim to superior sanctity and
power. But circumstances had placed them at the head of
their tribe; and when that tribe became the ministers of the
sanctuary, Aaron and his descendants necessarily occupied the
foremost place in its services. They were in a special sense
the guardians of the ark, and thus alone privileged to enter
the Holy of Holies, where Yahveh revealed Himself above the
cherubim. As long as there was but one sanctuary, it was
easy to maintain the distinction between the priest of the
house of Aaron and the ordinary Levite. But with the conquest
of Canaan all this was changed. Sanctuaries were
multiplied all over the land; the old high-places became seats
of the worship of Yahveh, and there were rival centres of
religious authority, like that of Baal-berith at Shechem, or that
of the graven image at Dan (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='eighteen'>xviii.</abbr> 14, etc.). Local
temples or tabernacles took the place of the one that was
hallowed by the presence of the ark, and the line of Aaron
fell into the background. In the age of national trouble and
disintegration which preceded the accession of Saul, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>character of the high-priestly family itself had much to do with
the loss of its power and influence. Eli, its representative at
Shiloh, was old and feeble, and his sons set at defiance the
Mosaic law, which required that Yahveh’s portion of the
sacrifice should be burned on the altar before the priests received
their share, and so they made ‘the offering of the Lord’ to be
‘abhorred.’ The capture of the ark by the Philistines and the
massacre of the priests at Nob by order of Saul completed the
dissolution of the high-priestly authority; and when the temple
at Jerusalem was built under Solomon, a new branch of the
family of Aaron was appointed to minister in it, and his descendants
became little more than hereditary court-chaplains.
It has even been doubted whether there was any high-priest,
properly so called, under the kings; if there were, he had
been divested of the power and position which had been
given him by the Levitical law.</p>

<p class='c003'>To conclude, however, as has sometimes been done by
modern criticism, that because the priests of Solomon’s temple
were no longer the high-priests of the Pentateuchal law,
therefore there had been no such high-priests at all, is contrary
to the evidence of archæology. Monumental discovery
has disclosed the fact that among the Semitic kinsmen of the
Israelites as well as in Chaldæa the high-priest preceded the
king. Not to speak of the <i>patesis</i> or high-priests of the Babylonian
cities who exercised royal sway within the limits of their
territories, like the Popes within the limits of the Romagna, the
earliest rulers both of Assyria and of Saba or Sheba in Southern
Arabia were high-priests. The Assyrian kings followed the
high-priests of the god Assur, and the Makârib or ‘high-priests’
of Saba came before the kings. Israel also had the
same experience. The Israelitish kings appeared at a comparatively
late period on the scene of Hebrew history, and
Saul was preceded by the high-priest Eli.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the book of Deuteronomy, it is true, we do not find the
distinction between ‘the priests, the sons of Aaron,’ and the
rest of the Levites that is made in the Levitical law. Here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>the priests are all alike called Levites; it is not ‘the priests,
the sons of Aaron,’ but ‘the priests the Levites’ who are
appointed to perform the highest offices of the sanctuary.
How far the phraseology is due to a different conception of
the Mosaic law, or how far it testifies to an older usage of
language, is a question which need not concern us; what is
important to observe is that the difference of expression is
linguistic and not historical. Historically all the priests were
Levites, though from the outset some of them must have been
assigned higher positions than others, and have been invested
with more sacred functions. The Levitical law draws the
distinction which the book of Deuteronomy is not so careful
to do. In fact, there was not the same necessity for doing so
in the case of the Deuteronomic retrospect.</p>

<p class='c003'>The tabernacle had been constructed, its services arranged,
and the grades and duties of its ministers appointed. Now,
therefore, disappointed in their hope of invading Canaan
from the south, the Israelites settled themselves tranquilly at
Kadesh, in the heart of the wilderness of Zin, and slowly
developed into a strong and united community. Here it was,
by the waters of En-Mishpat, that the legislation of Moses was
completed, and the undisciplined horde of fugitive serfs from
Egypt was moulded into a formidable band of warriors knit
together by a common religion and worship, and continually
gathering increased confidence in its own strength.<a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c013'><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>How long the Israelites remained in their desert fastness
we do not know. A time came when they once more resumed
their wanderings, or at all events a portion of them must have
done so. The Itinerary in <abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-three'>xxxiii.</abbr> gives a long list of
their encampments before they again found themselves in the
oasis of Kadesh. One of the places at which they rested was
Mount Shapher, another was Moseroth, of which we hear in
the book of Deuteronomy (<abbr title='ten'>x.</abbr> 6). Moseroth was in the
territory of the Horite tribe of Beni-Yaakan,<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c013'><sup>[225]</sup></a> and it was from
the Beeroth or ‘Wells’ of the Beni-Yaakan—Hashmonah, as it
is called in the Itinerary—that they had made their way to it.</p>

<p class='c003'>At Mosera or Moseroth, according to Deuteronomy, Aaron
died, and was succeeded in his office by his son Eleazar. The
statement, however, is not easily reconcileable with what we
are told in the book of Numbers. There it is said that the
death of the high-priest took place on the summit of Mount
Hor after the departure from Kadesh.<a id='r226'></a><a href='#f226' class='c013'><sup>[226]</sup></a> The fact that Gudgodah
was also called Hor-hagidgad, ‘the mountain of clefts,’
may have been the cause of the transference.</p>

<p class='c003'>But it must be remembered that Kadesh was merely the
headquarters of Israel during its weary years of waiting in the
wilderness. The scanty notice of the unsuccessful invasion of
Southern Palestine shows that it was only the camp as a whole
which remained fixed there. Like the Bedâwin of to-day,
portions of the tribes made distant expeditions, and the
Itinerary may relate rather to their encampments than to that
of the stationary part of the people. Kadesh was a sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>centre from which fragments of the main body could be sent
forth to scour the frontiers of Seir and Edom, or to encamp
at the foot of Ezion-geber on the Yâm Sûph.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the book of Numbers (<abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 14, 15) there is a quotation
from ‘the Book of the Wars of the Lord,’ one of the old
documents on which the history of Israel in the wilderness is
based. The introductory words are unintelligible as they stand,
thus testifying to the antiquity of the passage; all that can be
made out of them is that they relate not only to the struggle
between Israel and the Amorites at ‘the brooks of Arnon,’
but also to a previous war carried on by the Israelites ‘in
Suphah,’ near the gulf of Aqaba.<a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c013'><sup>[227]</sup></a> Here the Israelites would
have been on the borders of Edom, if indeed they were not
in Edom itself; and it is therefore noticeable that the Egyptian
Pharaoh, Ramses <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>, whose reign coincided with the period
of the wanderings of the Israelites in the desert, declares that
he had ‘smitten the Shasu (or Bedâwin) tribes of Seir and
plundered their tents’ (<i>ohélu</i>). Ramses <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> was the only
Pharaoh of Egypt who had ventured to attack the Edomite
Bedâwin in their mountain strongholds; while Canaan and
the plateau east of the Jordan had been Egyptian provinces
the inhabitants of Mount Seir had retained their independence.
The synchronism, therefore, of this Egyptian expedition
against, not the Edomites only, but ‘the Bedâwin of Seir’
and the war in which Israel was engaged ‘in Suphah,’ is, at
least, worthy of notice. It may be that part of the training
undergone by the Israelites in the desert for their future
conquest of Canaan was the help they had rendered their
kinsfolk of Edom in their contest with the old taskmasters of
the Hebrew tribes.</p>

<p class='c003'>However this may be, of the three leaders who had brought
Israel out of the house of bondage, Moses alone survived the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>long sojourn at Kadesh. Miriam had died there; the death
of Aaron also, if we may trust Deuteronomy, had taken place
before the final departure from the great desert sanctuary. In
any case, it had happened in sight of Kadesh, and before the
march had commenced which was to lead the Israelitish tribes
to the Promised Land. The time had now arrived when
Israel felt strong enough once more to attempt its conquest;
not, this time, by the road through the mountains of the south
along which Chedor-laomer had marched to Kadesh, but from
the plateau eastward of the Jordan where the kindred nations
of Moab and Ammon had already established themselves.
Here, too, the Israelites made their first permanent settlements
in the land which they had marked out for their own.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Canaanite population east of the Jordan was sparse
and weak compared with that to the west. It had been further
weakened by foreign conquest. Between the fall of the Egyptian
empire and the Israelitish invasion the Amorites under Sihon
had formed a kingdom and occupied the territory of Moab as
far south as the Arnon. As in the age of the eighteenth
dynasty, so too under the kings of the nineteenth dynasty,
Egyptian rule extended over what is called in one of the Tel
el-Amarna tablets ‘the field of Bashan.’ The so-called Sakhret
Eyyûb, or ‘Stone of Job,’ a little to the north of Tell ’Ashtereh,
eastward of the Jordan, has been discovered by Dr.
Schumacher to be a monument of Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr><a id='r228'></a><a href='#f228' class='c013'><sup>[228]</sup></a> The figure of
the Pharaoh is engraved upon it, with his name beside him,
as well as the figure of a deity who wears the crown of Osiris,
and is represented with a full face, while his Canaanitish name
is written in hieroglyphs.<a id='r229'></a><a href='#f229' class='c013'><sup>[229]</sup></a> At Luxor<a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c013'><sup>[230]</sup></a> Ramses claims Moab
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>among his conquests, and we may therefore gather that up to
the time of the Exodus the authority of Egypt had been
restored throughout the country east of the Jordan. But the
Libyan invasion shattered the strength of Egypt, and long
before the close of the nineteenth dynasty its possessions in
Palestine passed from it forever. This is precisely the period
to which the Pentateuch refers the kingdom of Og in Bashan
and the conquests of Sihon in Moab, and the Biblical and
monumental evidence thus stand in complete agreement.</p>

<p class='c003'>Moses had requested permission from the Edomite king to
pass through his dominions. The Song of Moses (<abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr>
15) still speaks of the <span lang="hbo"><i>alûphim</i></span>, or ‘dukes,’ of Edom, who had
originally governed the country; but while the Israelites had
been lingering in the desert, the ‘dukes’ had made way for an
elective monarchy. The dissolution of the Egyptian power
may have had something to do with this; possibly the invasion
of Mount Seir by Ramses <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> had produced the same result
in Edom that the Philistine invasion produced among the
Israelites, and had obliged them to elect a king. At all
events, the first king of Edom, we read, was ‘Bela, the son of
Beor.’ Bela, however, is merely a contracted form of Balaam,
and in the first Edomite king we must therefore see Balaam,
the son of Beor. What relation he bore to the seer from
Pethor will have to be considered later on.<a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c013'><sup>[231]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>It is not surprising that the Edomite king refused the
request that had been made to him. To have admitted
within his frontiers a large body of emigrants like the Israelites,
many of whom were armed, might have been as dangerous
as the passage of the Crusaders through the Eastern Empire
proved to Constantinople. The Israelites were not strong
enough to force their way through a hostile country, and very
reluctantly, therefore, they once more turned southward to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Gulf of Aqaba, and from thence marched northward again to
the east of Edom. Their route brought them to the southeastern
part of Moab.</p>

<p class='c003'>The people, we are told, bitterly complained of the length
of ‘the way.’ It was not strange. The Promised Land, so
constantly in sight, seemed always to recede as soon as it was
approached. They had vainly attempted to enter it from the
south; the Philistines kept garrison in the cities on the
Mediterranean coast; and now, when a third and last mode of
approach was undertaken, their brethren of Edom closed the
path. The road, too, which they were thus forced to adopt
led them through a desert, which the Assyrian king Esar-haddon
describes as a land of drought, inhabited only by
‘snakes and scorpions, which filled the ground like locusts.’<a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c013'><sup>[232]</sup></a>
These were the ‘fiery serpents’ that bit the Israelites and
increased their miseries. A memorial of their sufferings lasted
down to the age of Hezekiah. The brazen ‘seraph’ or
‘fiery serpent’ which had been wrought by order of Moses,
and planted on the top of a pole, was religiously preserved in
the chief sanctuary of the nation. Incense was burned before
it, for it had been the means of preserving the people from
the fiery poison of the snakes. But the idolatry of which it
was the object brought about its destruction. The relic,
which had been spared by the earlier kings and priests of
Judah, was destroyed by Hezekiah, who realised at last that
it was but ‘a piece of brass.’ It is true that doubts have
been cast upon its having actually been a monument of the
life in the wilderness; but it is difficult for the historian to
understand how a modern critic can be better informed on
such a point than the contemporaries of Hezekiah.<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c013'><sup>[233]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Zalmonah, Punon, and Oboth were the next stages on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>journey after Mount Hor. Then came Iye-ha-Abârim, ‘the
Ruins of the Hebrews’—a name, it may be, which contained a
reminiscence of the settlement of the Israelites in the country.<a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c013'><sup>[234]</sup></a>
Iye-ha-Abârim was in the plain east of Moab, under the
shadow of the mountain-range of Abarim. Then the stream
of the Zered was crossed, and the emigrants found themselves
in Moab. The banks of the Arnon were the next resting-place.</p>

<p class='c003'>The nation retained but little recollection of the dreary
years that had been passed in the wilderness. A few incidents
alone were recorded which had broken the monotony of
their desert life. But here, on the verge of Canaan and of
conquest, the national consciousness awakened into new life.
The song was handed down which had been sung when at some
station in the desert the ground had been pierced and water
found. ‘Spring up, O well!’ it said; ‘sing ye unto it. O
well that hast been dug by princes, that hast been pierced by
the nobles of the people, by (the direction of) the lawgiver,
with their staves!’ Similar songs, according to Professor
Goldziher, were sung in old days by the Arab kinsmen of the
Israelites when they too dug wells in the desert and the
refreshing water bubbled up from below.<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c013'><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Arnon was now the boundary between Moab and the new
kingdom of Sihon the Amorite. Sihon refused permission to
the Israelites to pass through his territories, along the ‘royal
highway,’ and endeavoured to stop their advance. But the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>tribes were no longer the undisciplined rabble who had fled
from the Canaanites of Zephath, and the result of the struggle
was the complete overthrow of the Amorite forces. The
district between the Arnon and the Jabbok, which had been
taken by Sihon from ‘the former king of Moab,’ was occupied
by the Israelites, who accordingly established themselves
midway between Moab and Ammon. It is on the occasion
of this conquest that the Hebrew historian has preserved the
fragment of an Amorite song of triumph which had celebrated
the capture of Ar, the Moabite capital, and which was now
embodied by the Israelites in a similar song of triumph for
their own victory over Sihon.</p>

<p class='c003'>Ammon was too strong to be attacked (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 24),
but ‘Moses sent to spy out Jaazer,’ not far from Rabbah, the
future capital of the Ammonites, and the fall of the Amorite
city of Jaazer brought with it the conquest of Gilead. The
tribes of Reuben and Gad were settled in the newly-acquired
districts, on condition, however, that they should acknowledge
their relationship to the rest of the tribes, and help the latter
in case of necessity (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-two'>xxxii.</abbr> 29-32; <abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v.</abbr> 15-17).
Gilead had been conquered by Machir, a branch of the tribe
of Manasseh (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-two'>xxxii.</abbr> 39; <abbr title='Deuteronomy'>Deut.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 15; <abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v.</abbr> 14),
and the conquest was subsequently extended further by
armed bands under chieftains, like Jair and Nobah, who
occupied outlying districts on their own account.<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c013'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The Havoth-Jair, or ‘Villages of Jair,’ were in the ‘stony’
region of Argob, the Trachonitis of Greek geography, which
extended northward to the Aramaic kingdoms of Geshur and
Maachah. It formed part of the ‘Field of Bashan,’ which in the
Mosaic age was ruled by Og ‘of the remnant of the Rephaim.’
Like Sihon, he is called an Amorite, and his two capitals were
at Edrei and Ashtaroth-Karnaim.<a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c013'><sup>[237]</sup></a> His rule was acknowledged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>from the Haurân in the south to Mount Hermon in the north,
and he must thus have been one of the native princes who
arose out of the ruins of the Egyptian empire. But his power
was shortlived. He was unable to withstand the shock of
the invaders from the desert, and his dominions became
Israelitish territory. It would seem that what was afterwards
the eastern side of Ammon was included in his kingdom,
since in after ages a huge sarcophagus of black basalt, which
was preserved in Rabbah of Ammon, was pointed out as his
‘iron bed’ (<abbr title='Deuteronomy'>Deut.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 11).</p>

<p class='c003'>These conquests of the Israelites doubtless occupied a considerable
space of time. Some of them, indeed, were made
after the Mosaic age, and were merely extensions of the
conquests made at that time. But the overthrow of Og must
have followed quickly on that of Sihon. A year or two
would have sufficed to allow the Israelitish bands to overrun
the districts to the north-east of the Arnon.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is not wonderful that the Moabites should have wished to
rid themselves of such dangerous neighbours. But their king,
Balak the son of Zippor,<a id='r238'></a><a href='#f238' class='c013'><sup>[238]</sup></a> was uncertain how to act. The
Moabite forces were no match for the fierce desert-tribes who
had overthrown Sihon and burnt his towns. An embassy
was accordingly sent to the seer, Balaam the son of Beor, who
lived at Pethor on the Euphrates, in ‘the land of the children
of Ammo.’ The site of Pethor has been recovered from the
Assyrian monuments. It lay on the west bank of the
Euphrates, a little to the north of its junction with the Sajur,
and consequently only a few miles south of the Hittite capital
Carchemish, now Jerablûs. The Beni-Ammo must have
claimed the same ancestry as the Beni-Ammi or Ammonites,
and the name is probably to be found in that of the country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>of Ammiya or Ammi, which is mentioned in the Tel el-Amarna
tablets.<a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c013'><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The fame of Balaam must have been widespread. But it is
permissible to ask whether the only object of the embassy was
that the seer should ‘curse’ the descendants of Jacob. A
curse usually meant something more substantial than a form
of words; and, as we have already seen, the first Edomite
king given in the extract from the chronicles of Edom bears
the same name and has the same father as Balaam. Did
Balaam end by becoming elected king of Edom, and finally
falling in battle against the Israelites, along with his allies the
Midianitish chiefs?<a id='r240'></a><a href='#f240' class='c013'><sup>[240]</sup></a> The materials for an answer are not yet
before us.</p>

<p class='c003'>The story of Balaam seems to form an episode by itself.
The narrative and the prophecies constitute a single whole,
which cannot be torn apart. It is the first example in the
Old Testament of a written prophecy, and that the prophet
should have been a Gentile diviner is of itself significant.
Nothing can be more vivid and lifelike than the picture that
is presented to us. We see the ambassadors of Balak persuading
the half-reluctant seer to accompany them; we read of
the strange miracles that accompanied the journey, and of the
altars that were reared, and the sacrifices that were offered in
the hope that his enchantments might prevail over those of
Israel. He was taken from high-place to high-place, whence
he could look down upon the distant hosts of the enemy, and
upon each, in Babylonian fashion, seven altars were erected.
But all was unavailing. The God of Jacob refused to be
turned from His purpose by the bullocks and the rams that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>were offered Him, and the curses of the Aramæan seer were
turned into blessings. When Balaam fell into the prophetic
trance, seeing ‘the vision of the Almighty, but having his eyes
open,’ the words which were put into his mouth were words
which predicted the future glories of Israel. ‘A star should
come out of Jacob, and a sceptre should arise out of Israel,
which should smite the corners of Moab and destroy all the
children of Sheth.’<a id='r241'></a><a href='#f241' class='c013'><sup>[241]</sup></a> Edom, too, should at last become the
possession of his younger brother, and the Amalekites of the
desert should perish for ever.</p>

<p class='c003'>The age of the episode has been often disputed. Much
depends on the question whether the references in the last
prophecy to the Kenites and others belong to the original
document, or are later insertions. The Assyrians did not
penetrate into the desert south of Judah, where the Kenites lived,
until the time of Tiglath-pileser <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> and Sargon in the eighth
century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> The Amalekites were destroyed by Saul; Moab
and Edom were conquered by David. But the concluding verse
of the prophecy is at present difficult to explain. When was
it that ships came from Cyprus and ‘afflicted’ Assyria and the
Hebrews, so that they too perished for ever? In the age of
the Exodus, the pirates of the Greek seas joined their forces
with those of the Libyans in the invasion of Egypt, and the
Philistines and their allies sailed from Krete and other islands
of the Mediterranean, and established themselves on the coast
of Palestine. Was it here that the Hebrews lived who were
to perish for ever? It is, at any rate, worthy of note that it
was the Philistines more especially among whom the Israelites
were known as the ‘Hebrews.’ In the time of the Tel el-Amarna
tablets we already hear of Assyrian intrigues in the
far West. The Babylonian king asks the Pharaoh why the
Assyrians, his ‘vassals,’ have been allowed to come to Canaan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>and enter into relations with the Egyptian court.<a id='r242'></a><a href='#f242' class='c013'><sup>[242]</sup></a> At a later
period, while Israel was ruled by judges, more than one
Assyrian monarch actually made his way to the Mediterranean
coast.<a id='r243'></a><a href='#f243' class='c013'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>As the historical chapters of the book of Isaiah, including
the prophecies contained in them, have been embodied in the
book of Kings, so, too, the history of Balaam and Balak has
been embodied in the book of Numbers. There is no reason for
denying its substantial authenticity. Written prophecies were
already known both in Egypt and in Babylonia,<a id='r244'></a><a href='#f244' class='c013'><sup>[244]</sup></a> and it is
almost inconceivable that a Jewish fabricator of prophecies
would have made a Gentile diviner the mouthpiece of Yahveh.
Moreover, there is nothing in the narrative or the prophecies
themselves which is inconsistent with the date to which they
profess to belong, unless indeed it is maintained that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>conquest of Moab and Edom by the Israelites could not have
been predicted at the time. But, apart from theological considerations
which lie outside the province of the historian, it
did not require much political foresight to conclude that a
people which had begun by destroying the power of Sihon was
likely to end by conquering the nations surrounding them. In
fact, it would seem from the enumeration of the cities occupied
by Reuben and Gad (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-two'>xxxii.</abbr> 34-38) that at one time
little, if any, territory was left to the Moabite king.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the embassy to Balaam ‘the elders of Midian’ are united
with those of Moab. In fact, it is to the ‘elders of Midian,’
and not to those of Moab, that Balak first addresses himself
(<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-two'>xxii.</abbr> 4). It is the Midianites, moreover, and not the
Moabites, who tempted Israel to sin ‘in the matter of Baal-Peor,’
and who were accordingly massacred in the war that
followed, although ‘the people had begun to commit whoredom’
with ‘the daughters of Moab’ (<abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-five'>xxv.</abbr> 1). It is
clear, therefore, that Moab was at the time occupied by the
Midianites, just as the eastern portion of Israelitish territory
was occupied by them in later days before it was freed by
Gideon. Then they had swarmed up from the south along
with the Amalekite Bedâwin and the Kadmônim of the south-east,
and under their five shêkhs had overrun the land of
Israel. Moab had now undergone the same fate, perhaps in
consequence of its weakened condition after the unsuccessful
war against Sihon. At any rate, it is probable that the
Moabites had eventually to thank their Edomite neighbours
for their deliverance from the invaders, since in the list of the
Edomite kings we are told that the fourth of them, Hadad,
the son of Bedad, ‘smote Midian in the field of Moab’ (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr>
<abbr title='thirty-six'>xxxvi.</abbr> 35). The age of Hadad and that of Gideon could
not have been far apart, and Gideon’s success may therefore
have been one of the results that followed upon the Midianite
defeat in Moab. The losses sustained by the Midianites,
however, in their struggle with the invading Israelites, must
have weakened their hold upon the territories of the Moabite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>king. The storm-cloud which had terrified Balak passed over
him to his Midianite foes.</p>

<p class='c003'>The conquest of the Moabite cities brought with it intermarriages
between the Israelites and their inhabitants as well
as an adoption of the native forms of faith. Yahveh was
deserted for Baal-Peor, the Moabite Baal of Mount Peor, but
it was not long before He avenged Himself. Pestilence broke
out in the camp, and the people saw in it the finger of God.
By command of Moses ‘all the heads of the people’ were
‘hanged before the Lord in face of the sun’; while Phinehas,
the son of the high-priest, jealous of the rights of Yahveh,
stabbed to the death an Israelite and his Midianitish wife who
had dared to show themselves before the sanctuary of the
Lord. The time had passed when Moses was justified in
marrying a wife of Midianitish race; Israel had now become
a peculiar people, dedicated to Yahveh, who would allow ‘no
other god’ to share His place. The Midianitish wife was a
sign and evidence that Yahveh of Israel had been forsaken
for a Midianitish Baal.</p>

<p class='c003'>Thus far, it would seem, Israel and Midian had mixed
together on friendly terms. Both were desert tribes, both
were connected together by old traditions and intercourse,
and claimed descent from a common ancestor. But it was
now a question of rival deities and forms of faith. The very
existence of the Law that had been promulgated from Sinai
and Kadesh was at stake; and if Israel and its religion were
not to be absorbed into the world of heathenism around
them, it was time for the tribe of Levi—the keepers of the
sanctuary—to awake. Moses and Phinehas saw the danger,
and swift punishment descended on the backsliders within
Israel itself. How formidable, however, the danger had been
may be gathered from the statement that ‘all the heads of the
people’ were put to death.</p>

<p class='c003'>The turn of Midian came next. The Midianite tribes were
overthrown, and their five shêkhs slain, one of whom, Rekem,
gave his name to the city which is better known as Petra.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>‘Balaam also, the son of Beor, they slew with the sword.’
The Midianite villages and forts were burned to the ground,
and the captives and spoil were brought to the Israelitish
camp. Here they were divided among the people, Yahveh
and His priests receiving their share. Out of a total of
16,000 captives, thirty-two slaves were given to the Lord.
Henceforth it became the rule that the spoil taken in war
should be divided into two equal parts, one-half for the
fighting men, the rest for the people as a whole; and that
while the fighting men had to deliver up only one share in
five hundred to the Levites, the priestly tribute levied on the
rest of the ‘congregation’ was as much as one in fifty. The
regulation was reinforced by David after his defeat of the
Amalekites when his companions clamoured for the whole of
the spoil (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty'>xxx.</abbr> 24, 25), at all events in so far as the
equal division of it was concerned between the combatants
and those who remained at home.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Midianites were driven from Moab and its frontiers.
Their overthrow meant the triumph of the priestly tribe in
Israel. The war had been waged not against Midian only,
but against the allies and kinsmen of Midian in Israel itself.
The old relationship between Israel and Midian had been
severed on the confines of the Promised Land; the supremacy
of Yahveh in Israel had been once more asserted, and Israel
had become more than ever His peculiar people. Before
they entered Canaan, it was needful that the last links that
bound them to the wild tribes of the desert should be cut
in two.</p>

<p class='c003'>The work of Moses was completed. He had led Israel
from the house of bondage, had given it laws and made it a
nation in the wilderness, and had fitted it for the conquest of
Canaan. The land flowing with milk and honey, which the
Semitic settlers in Egypt seem always to have regarded as a
home of refuge to which they should ultimately return, was
now within their grasp. Egyptian troops no longer garrisoned
it, and its population was weakened by intestine troubles, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>the long war between Egypt and the Hittites, and, above all,
by the invasion of the Philistines and other pirates from the
Greek seas. A large portion of the cultivated territory on the
east side of the Jordan was already in Israelite hands; all that
was needed was to cross the river and take possession of
‘the land of promise.’ Israel never forgot that it was from
hence that its ancestors had come, and tradition recorded
that the bodies of the patriarchs still lay in the rock-tomb of
Machpelah. Even now the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh
carried with them the mummy of Joseph, from whom they
claimed their origin, ready to deposit it wherever they could
gain a permanent foothold and build for themselves a central
sanctuary.</p>

<p class='c003'>The scene of the last legislation of Moses is laid in the
plains of Moab, in the newly-won territory of Israel, and
almost within sight of the mountains of Canaan. The additional
laws and regulations which needed to be made were
not many. Reuben and Gad were settled in the districts
which subsequently bore their names, the Reubenites pasturing
their flocks like nomad Bedâwin among the northern wadis
of Moab, while Gad occupied the greater portion of the
Amorite kingdom of Sihon. Part of the tribe of Manasseh
also made its home in the districts of Gilead and Bashan,
which it had won by the sword.</p>

<p class='c003'>The institution of the six cities of refuge, moreover, as well
as of the forty-eight cities of the Levites, is assigned to the
same period. Modern criticism, however, has shown itself
unwilling to accept its Mosaic authorship. But sacred cities,
to which the homicide could flee for refuge, were an ancient
institution in both Syria and Asia Minor. We find them also
in the region of the Hittites. Such <i>asyla</i>, as the Greeks
called them, lasted down to the classical period, and played a
considerable part in the local history of Asia Minor. Wherever
we find a Kadesh or a Hierapolis, there we may expect to
find also an asylum in which the gods and their ministers
would protect the unintentional shedder of blood from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>vengeance of man. It was a means of checking the <i>vendetta</i>
or blood feud, which was in full harmony with primitive law.<a id='r245'></a><a href='#f245' class='c013'><sup>[245]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>In establishing the cities of refuge, therefore, the Israelites
did but carry on the traditions of the past. And two at least
of the cities, which were subsequently set apart for the purpose,
were sanctuaries, and consequently ‘asyla,’ long before
the children of Jacob entered Palestine. These were Kadesh
in Galilee and Hebron (<abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty'>xx.</abbr> 7). The name of Kadesh
declares its sacred character, and the sanctuary of Hebron
had been famous for centuries.</p>

<p class='c003'>The institution of the Levitical cities, again, was a result of
the new position assigned to the tribe of Levi as the priests
and representatives of the national God. The overthrow of
the Midianites and their Israelitish allies had definitely settled
the place of the tribe in Israel. Yahveh had prevailed over
all other gods, and those who worshipped another god had
been put to the sword. It had been the work of Levi, of
those who had been chosen to be the ministers of Yahveh or
had voluntarily devoted themselves to the service of the
sanctuary. On the day that the spoil of Midian was divided
it was recognised that Levi was not a tribe in the sense that
the other tribes were so; it represented the priests and
ministers of Yahveh, whoever and wheresoever they might be.
And as, in the division of the spoil, due care was taken of
Yahveh and His priests, so, too, in the division of the land,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>it was needful that similar care should be taken for them.
The priests of Egypt had their lands, out of the revenues of
which the temples were supported, and Egypt was not the
only country of the Oriental world in which the same practice
prevailed. Indeed, while Canaan was an Egyptian province
temples had been built in it by the Pharaohs, and doubtless
endowed in the same way as the temples of Egypt itself.
The revenues of Syrian towns, moreover, had been given to
Egyptian temples; Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>, for example, immediately
after the conquest of Syria, settled three of its towns (Anaugas,
Innuam, and Harankal) upon Amon of Thebes.<a id='r246'></a><a href='#f246' class='c013'><sup>[246]</sup></a> The custom
lingered on into late times; the Persian king assigned the
three cities of Magnesia, Myos, and Lampsacus for the maintenance
of Themistoklês,<a id='r247'></a><a href='#f247' class='c013'><sup>[247]</sup></a> and the taxes of the Fayyûm in
Egypt formed the ‘pin-money’ of Queen Arsinoê Philadelphos.<a id='r248'></a><a href='#f248' class='c013'><sup>[248]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Later ages misunderstood the regulations that related to
the Levitical cities, and, misled by the belief that the tribe of
Levi was constituted like the other tribes of Israel, imagined
that they were intended to be places where the Levites should
dwell and none else. This misconception has coloured the
existing text of <abbr title='Numbers'>Numb.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-five'>xxxv.</abbr> 2-8, but we have only to turn to
the list of the cities given in <abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> to see how unfounded
it is. In fact, the Levites, as ministers of the national God,
lived wherever there was a sanctuary of Yahveh to be served;
in the days of the Judges we find a Levite even in the private
house of Micah, on Mount Ephraim, from whence he is
taken by the Danite raiders along with the image of his God
(<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='eighteen'>xviii.</abbr>). There was no intention of shutting up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Levites in certain cities apart from the rest of the people; on
the contrary, they were to be ‘scattered’ throughout Israel,
the priests and representatives everywhere of the national God.</p>

<p class='c003'>The book of Deuteronomy is the testament of Moses.
Even the most sceptical criticism admits that such was already
the belief in the age of Josiah, so far, at any rate, as regards
the main portion of the book. At the same time, the stoutest
advocates of the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch also
admit that it cannot all have come from his hand. The
account of his death, which forms the close of the book,
cannot have been written by the great legislator himself.
Here, as elsewhere, it is for the historian to decide where the
narrative may belong to the Mosaic age, and where it transports
us to the atmosphere of a later period.</p>

<p class='c003'>The original Deuteronomy of philological criticism begins
with the twelfth chapter, without introduction or even explanation.
The Deuteronomy of Hebrew tradition is the
fitting conclusion of the Pentateuch. Moses, worn out with
years and labour, addresses his people for the last time.
They are about to cross the Jordan and enter Canaan; here
on the threshold of the Promised Land his task is done, and
he must leave the work of conquest to other and younger
hands. He has been the legislator of Israel, Joshua must be
its general.</p>

<p class='c003'>We have, first, a recapitulation of the chief events of the
wanderings in the wilderness from the day that the Covenant
was made in Horeb, the mount of God.<a id='r249'></a><a href='#f249' class='c013'><sup>[249]</sup></a> They are intermingled
with antiquarian notes, which may, or may not, be of
the Mosaic age, as well as with exhortations to obedience
to the Law. Then follows a series of enactments which
constitute the Deuteronomic Law itself. The enactments
necessarily go over some of the ground already traversed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>the previous legislation; in some points they even seem to
contradict it. But the contradictions are more apparent than
real, like the reason assigned for observing the Sabbath.
Sometimes they are supplementary to the Levitical laws,
sometimes are supplemented by the latter; at other times the
same regulation is repeated from a different point of view.<a id='r250'></a><a href='#f250' class='c013'><sup>[250]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>A special characteristic of the Deuteronomic Law is its
tenderness and care for animals as well as for the poor, ‘the
stranger, the fatherless, and the widow.’<a id='r251'></a><a href='#f251' class='c013'><sup>[251]</sup></a> Even the Egyptian
is not to be ‘abhorred’ (<abbr title='Deuteronomy'>Deut.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-three'>xxiii.</abbr> 7), and all Hebrew slaves
are to be released every seventh year. Along with this, however,
we find the ferocity which distinguished the Semites in
time of war. If the enemy lived afar off, all the males of a
vanquished city were to be mercilessly slain, and the children
and women spared, only to become the slaves and concubines
of the conquerors. But even this amount of mercy was forbidden
in the case of the Canaanitish cities; here the massacre
was to be universal, lest the Israelites should take wives from
the conquered population and fall away from the worship of
Yahveh. A similar spirit of ferocity breathes through the
Assyrian inscriptions, where the kings boast of the multitudes
of the vanquished whom they had tortured and slain in
honour of their god Assur. Alone of the ancient nations of
the East the Egyptians seem to have understood what we
mean by humanity in war.</p>

<p class='c003'>Like the poor, the Levite is commended to the care and
support of the people. He has no land or property of his
own—much less a ‘Levitical city,’—the Lord alone ‘is his
inheritance,’ and consequently those who remember the Levite
remember at the same time the Lord whom he serves. The
portion of the offering is defined which is to be the due of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Levites, and tithe is to be paid to them upon all the produce
of the land. No distinction is drawn in the book of Deuteronomy
between the Levites and the priests, ‘the sons of
Aaron,’ and therefore the laws relating to the Levites apply
to all the priests alike.</p>

<p class='c003'>Another characteristic of the Deuteronomic Law is its
insistence on a central sanctuary. It was to this central
sanctuary that the God-fearing Israelite was commanded to
‘go up’ three times in the year at each of the great feasts,
and there offer his firstlings and sacrifices to the Lord. This
central sanctuary, however, did not exclude the existence of
local altars or shrines. The Levite is described as living in
the families of the other tribes throughout the land (<abbr title='twelve'>xii.</abbr> 19,
<abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 27), and as deciding cases at law, wherever they might
occur, along with the judges (<abbr title='sixteen'>xvi.</abbr> 18, <abbr title='seventeen'>xvii.</abbr> 9, <abbr title='nineteen'>xix.</abbr> 17, <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 6).
Nor was it necessary when an animal was slaughtered, and its
life-blood poured out before Yahveh, that this should be done
in the one chief temple of the nation. It was only such
offerings as had been specially vowed to the national God
that were required to be brought there. They had been
dedicated to Yahveh as God of the whole nation, and it was
therefore to that sanctuary in which Yahveh was worshipped
by the nation as a whole that they had to be taken. In his
individual or local capacity the Israelite was free to offer his
sacrifices where he would. For, it must be remembered, the
very fact that the life-blood was shed made the death of the
animal a sacrifice to the Lord, and the feast on its flesh which
followed was a feast eaten in the presence of the Lord.</p>

<p class='c003'>The insistence on the central sanctuary implied an equal
insistence on the absolute supremacy of Yahveh in Israel.
Idolaters and enticers to idolatry were to be cut off without
pity; even the prophet who spoke in the name of another
god, and whose words came to pass, was to be stoned to
death. The fulfilment of a prediction guaranteed its truth
only if the prophet was the messenger of Yahveh. Yahveh
would suffer no other gods to be worshipped at His side, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>the Deuteronomic Law accordingly forbids all such practices
as were connected with the heathenism of the neighbouring
peoples. The Israelites were forbidden to tattoo themselves
like the Syrian worshippers of Hadad, to scarify their flesh
like the Egyptians in mourning for the dead, far less like the
Canaanites around them to sacrifice their firstborn by fire.
Every effort was made to preserve them from contact with
their neighbours; their king was forbidden to ‘multiply’
horses and wives; for the one would lead to intercourse with
Egypt, the other would introduce into Israel the worship and
the images of foreign deities. The sacred trees which from
time immemorial had been planted near the altars of the
gods, some of them by the patriarchs themselves, were to be
destroyed like the conical pillar of the goddess Asherah and
the upright column which symbolised the sun-god.</p>

<p class='c003'>Few aspects of Hebrew life are left untouched by the enactments
of Deuteronomy. Marriage and divorce, murder and
other crimes, the institution of the cities of refuge, the
observance of the great feasts, the election and duty of a
king, sanitary laws including the distinction between clean
and unclean meats, slavery, commerce, and usury, are all
alike subjects of the Deuteronomic legislation. And the whole
legislation is marked by a spirit of compassion for the poor
and suffering, at all events if they belong to the house of
Israel, or have been allowed to share some of its privileges.
The creditor is enjoined to give back to the poor man before
nightfall the raiment he had taken in pledge, and the master
is bidden to pay at the close of the day the wages of ‘the
hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy
brethren or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy
gates.’ Even the curious prohibition to mix like and unlike
together, as in the case of a garment of wool and linen (xxii.
11), seems to be a reduction from the principle which forbade
the yoking together of the ox and ass.</p>

<p class='c003'>The legislation relating to the king is perhaps somewhat
striking, especially when we bear in mind the protest raised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>by Samuel against the election of one (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='seven'>vii.</abbr> 6-18).
Samuel, however, was not altogether disinterested in the
matter; and it was obvious that as soon as the conquest of
Canaan was completed, there could be no national unity without
a monarch who could represent the people and lead them
in war. Before the time of Samuel, Abimelech had established
a kingdom in Central Palestine, and tradition spoke of Moses
also as ‘king in Jeshurun’ (<abbr title='Deuteronomy'>Deut.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-three'>xxxiii.</abbr> 5). The Israelites,
if ever they were to form a nation, were destined to follow the
example of their neighbours; even in the wild fastnesses of
Mount Seir the ‘dukes’ of Edom had been succeeded by
kings. The idea of kingship was so familiar to the Mosaic
age, that it is difficult to conceive of any legislation which did
not contemplate it. Whether the legislation would have taken
precisely the same form as that which we find in Deuteronomy
is another question.</p>

<p class='c003'>The commandments enjoined by Moses were ordered to be
written on the stuccoed face of ‘great stones.’ Whether the
whole of the Deuteronomic legislation is meant is more than
doubtful. But that the chief enactments of the code should
be thus placed before the eyes of the people was in accordance
with the customs of the age. The acts and events of the
reign of Augustus engraved on the marble slabs of Ancyra
are a late example of the same usage; and the great inscription
of Darius on the cliff of Behistun has similarly preserved to
us the history of the foundation of the Persian empire. To
cover stone or rock with stucco, which was then painted white
and written upon, was a common practice in Egypt. It seems
to imply, however, that the writing could be painted with the
brush, and thus to exclude the use of cuneiform characters.
At the same time, these characters could be cut in stucco as
well as in stone, and it is possible that the stucco was intended
to be a substitute for clay, where a large surface had to be
covered. However this may be, the monument was ordered
to be erected on Mount Ebal, by the side of an altar of
unwrought stones.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>On Ebal, moreover, and the opposite height of Gerizim, it
was prescribed that a strange ceremony should be performed.
While half the tribes stood on the one mountain, and the other
half on the other mountain, the Levites were to curse from
Ebal all those who disobeyed the law, and to bless from
Gerizim those who obeyed it.<a id='r252'></a><a href='#f252' class='c013'><sup>[252]</sup></a> Unfortunately, as might have
been expected, the curses much predominated over the blessings.
We hear afterwards in the book of Joshua that the
ceremony was duly performed, excepting only that Joshua
read the words of cursing and benediction in place of ‘the
priests the Levites.’ Critics have doubted the historical
character of the occurrence, but it is inconsistent with no
known fact, and it is difficult to find a reason for its gratuitous
invention.</p>

<p class='c003'>The latter part of the book of Deuteronomy brings the life
of Moses to an end. It includes the final covenant made
between himself on behalf of Yahveh and the people of Israel,
to which are attached the various calamities that would await
the breaking of it. It also tells us that the law contained in
Deuteronomy was really written by the legislator, and delivered
to the priests the sons of Levi with an injunction that it should
be read every seventh year (<abbr title='thirty-one'>xxxi.</abbr> 9-11). Like the ‘witness’
to <abbr title='Saint'>S.</abbr> John’s Gospel, therefore, the compiler of the Pentateuch
in its present form wishes to add his testimony to the belief
that the Mosaic law was written by Moses himself.</p>

<p class='c003'>Two songs, attributed to Moses, are also incorporated in
the book. They seem to be a reflection of the curses and
blessings pronounced respectively on Ebal and Gerizim. The
one paints the sufferings which forgetfulness of Yahveh was to
bring upon Israel; the other describes the future happiness
and glory of the several tribes. Chiefest among them are
Levi and the house of Joseph; ‘the precious things’ of the
Promised Land are reserved for Ephraim and Manasseh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>whose warriors shall drive the enemies of Yahveh to the ends
of the earth. Levi shall be the lawgiver and instructor of
Israel, while Benjamin shall be the ‘beloved of the Lord,’
who shall ‘dwell between his shoulders’ at Shiloh. Judah,
on the other hand, stands in the background; little is said of
him except a prayer that he should be delivered from his
enemies. And Simeon is passed over altogether. It is plain
that this second song or ‘blessing’ must be of early date.
It cannot be later than the early days of the conquest of
Canaan, when Ephraim and Manasseh were still the most
powerful of the tribes, and when the tabernacle of Yahveh was
erected at Shiloh. The tribes were still united among themselves;
they still recognised a common God and a common
worship, and had not as yet fallen upon the evil days depicted
in the book of Judges. The tone of the song throughout is
that of triumph and success; the Israelites must have still
been in their first flush of victory, and the house of Joseph
have still been their leader in war. But history knows of only
two periods when such was the case; the one period that
which followed the conquest of the Amorite kingdoms east of
the Jordan, the other period that which saw Joshua the
Ephraimite at the head of the armies of Israel. Hebrew
antiquity decided that it was to the first period that the song
belonged.<a id='r253'></a><a href='#f253' class='c013'><sup>[253]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The death of Moses was placed on the summit of one of
the mountains of Abarim—the mountains of the ‘Hebrews’—in
the land of Moab over against the temple of Baal-Peor.
On the one side he looked down upon the scene of his last
victory over the opponents of his law, on the place where the
Midianites and their Israelitish sympathisers had been slain;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>on the other side lay the Land of Promise, to the borders of
which he had led his people. The peak of Pisgah on which
he stood had been dedicated in old days to the worship of
Nebo, the Babylonian god of prophecy and literature, the
interpreter of the will of Merodach, the supreme divinity of
Babylon. It was no accident that the prophet and legislator
of Israel, the interpreter of the will of Yahveh, should die on
the same mountain-peak.</p>

<p class='c003'>The high-places which the kindred Semitic nations dedicated
to the gods become in the history of Israel the scenes of the
death of its great men. Aaron dies on the summit of Mount
Hor, and even to-day the tomb of the prophet Samuel is
pointed out on the lofty top of Mizpah. But no tomb
marked the spot where Moses died; alone among the heroes
of Hebrew history he was buried in a foreign land, and the
place where he was buried was unknown. The legislator of
Israel, he who had made Israel a nation, and with whom
Israelitish history began, vanished utterly out of sight. The
fact is a strange one, whatever be the explanation we attempt
to give of it. Can it be that Moab had been more completely
conquered by Israel than the narrative in the Pentateuch
would lead us to suppose, but that with the death of Moses
the dominion of Israel passed away?<a id='r254'></a><a href='#f254' class='c013'><sup>[254]</sup></a> In that case Moab
would have had little interest in preserving a memory of the
last resting-place of its conqueror, and the time would soon
have come when its site was forgotten.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'>Joshua not the Conqueror of Canaan—The Conquest gradual—The Passage of the
Jordan—Jericho, Ai and the Gibeonites—Battle of Makkedah—Lachish and Hazor—The
Kenizzites at Hebron and Kirjath-Sepher—Shechem—Death of Joshua.</p>
<p class='c004'>Hebrew tradition ascribed the conquest of Canaan to Joshua
the son of Nun. But when we come to examine the book of
Joshua or the book of Judges, we find that the extent of his
work has been greatly magnified in the imagination of later
ages. The Ephraimitish chieftain successfully established
Israel on the western side of the Jordan, gained permanent
possession of Mount Ephraim, and defeated the Canaanitish
princes to the south and north. But the conquest of Canaan
was a longer work, which was not completed till the days of
David and Solomon.</p>

<p class='c003'>The first chapter of Judges tells us in outline what the map
of Palestine was like after the settlement of the Israelitish
tribes. In the south the mountainous country was held by
the Edomite tribe of Caleb as well as by the more strictly
Israelitish tribe of Judah. But it was only ‘the mountain’
that was thus held. Though ‘the Lord was with Judah,’ he
‘could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because
they had chariots of iron.’ Further south, however, Judah
and Simeon in combination succeeded in making themselves
masters of the Negeb or desert plain as far as Zephath, where
a mixed population, partly Israelitish, partly Edomite, and
partly Kenite, took the place of the older inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c003'>Jerusalem remained in the hands of the Jebusites until it
was captured by David. It is true, we read (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 8) that
‘the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had
taken it and smitten it with the edge of the sword.’ But if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>so, it must soon have been again fortified by its former
possessors, since we are expressly told (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 21) that the
children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that
inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites ‘dwell with the
children of Judah in Jerusalem unto this day.’<a id='r255'></a><a href='#f255' class='c013'><sup>[255]</sup></a> Modern
critics have been in the habit of dismissing the alleged capture
of the city as unhistorical, but it is quite possible that
Jerusalem really suffered momentarily from a sudden raid.
The capture of the city is not ascribed to Joshua—indeed,
though he defeated its king and his allies, he seems to have
made no effort to reduce the city itself—and it is said to have
been effected by Judah after Joshua’s death. This may have
been at any time during the period of the Judges. The Tel
el-Amarna tablets show us how easily the cities of Canaan
could be taken and retaken in the course of local quarrels,
and the fact that Jerusalem was for a while in Jewish hands
seems to form an integral part of the story of the conquest of
Bezek.</p>

<p class='c003'>Even the great sanctuary of Beth-el, destined to be the
possession of Benjamin as well as of Ephraim,<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c013'><sup>[256]</sup></a> had not fallen
into the hands of ‘the house of Joseph’ when Joshua died,
though the ‘ruined heap’ of Ai which lay near it was one of
the first of the Israelitish conquests. All the chief towns in
the territory of Manasseh—Megiddo and Taanach, Dor and
Beth-Shean—remained Canaanite, the utmost that Israel
could do in the days of its strength being to exact tribute from
them. Gezer defied the power of Ephraim down to the time
when it was given to Solomon by the Egyptian Pharaoh; while
the great cities of Zebulon and Naphtali, like those of
Manasseh, never became Israelitish, but paid tribute to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Hebrews whenever the latter were ‘strong.’ Asher failed to
secure the territory that had been assigned to him, where
Moses in his song had promised that his foot should be dipped
in oil and his sandals should be of iron and bronze. The
Phœnicians continued to hold the coast long after the
Israelitish tribes had been carried into Assyrian captivity, and
even in the mountains that overlooked the shore the Asherites
were forced to live and be lost among the older Canaanites
(<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 32). ‘The children of Dan’ were in even worse
case; the Amorites drove them into the mountains and ‘would
not suffer them to come down to the valley.’ When at last
their enemies were made tributary by ‘the house of Joseph,’ it
was too late; the tribe of Dan was merged into that of Judah,
or had found a refuge in the city of Laish in the extreme
north.</p>

<p class='c003'>Joshua, therefore, was not the conqueror of Canaan in any
exact sense of the term. The districts east of the Jordan had
been occupied by the Israelites before the death of Moses, and
north of Moab the occupation had been fairly complete. In
Canaan itself the amount of territory won by Joshua was
practically confined to the passage over the Jordan and the
mountainous region of the centre. Few of the Canaanitish
cities were captured by him; and with the exception of Jericho
and Lachish, and perhaps Hazor, none of them was of
primary importance. But he succeeded in doing what had
been attempted in vain in earlier days; he led his people into
Palestine, and planted them there so firmly that the future
conquest of the whole country became merely a matter of
time.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was at Jericho, ‘the city of palms,’ that the passage into
Canaan was forced. The army of Israel crossed the Jordan
dry-shod, for ‘the waters which came down from above stood
and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that
is beside Zaretan; and those which came down towards the
sea of the plain, even the Salt Sea, failed, and were cut off.’
A similar phenomenon is recorded as having occurred in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Middle Ages. <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Clermont-Ganneau has pointed out a
passage in the Arabic historian Nowairi, in which an account
is given of the construction in <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 1266 of a bridge across the
Jordan by the Sultan Beybars <abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> of Egypt, when in consequence
of a landslip the bed of the river was for a time left dry. The
bridge was built on five arches between the stream of the
Qurawa and Tel Damieh, perhaps the Adam of the Old
Testament. But no sooner was it completed than ‘part of the
piers gave way. The Sultan was greatly vexed, and blamed
the builders, and sent them back to repair the damage. They
found the task very difficult, owing to the rise of the waters
and the strength of the current. But in the night preceding
the dawn of the 17th of the month Rabi the First of the year
of the Hijra 666 (<abbr class='spell'><i>i.e.</i></abbr> the 8th of December, <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 1267) the
water of the river ceased to flow so that none remained in its
bed. The people hurried and kindled numerous fires and
cressets, and seized the opportunity offered by the occurrence.
They remedied the defects in the piers, and strengthened
them, and effected repairs which would otherwise have been
impossible. They then despatched mounted men to ascertain
the nature of the event that had occurred. The riders urged
their horses, and found that a lofty mound (<i>Kabâr</i>) which
overlooked the river on the west had fallen into it and dammed
it up. A <i>Kabâr</i> resembles a hill, but is not actually a hill, for
water will quickly disintegrate it into mud. The water was
held up, and had spread itself over the valley above the dam.
The messengers returned with this explanation, and the water
was arrested from midnight until the 4th hour of the day.
Then the water prevailed upon the dam and broke it up. The
water flowed down in a body equal in depth to the length of a
lance, but made no impression upon the building owing to the
strength given to it.’<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c013'><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>The megalithic ‘circle’ of Gilgal commemorated the passage
of the Jordan. The camp was fixed there, and a popular
etymology explained the name by the circumcision that had
‘rolled away the reproach of Egypt.’<a id='r258'></a><a href='#f258' class='c013'><sup>[258]</sup></a> Jericho, the city of the
‘Moon-god’ Yârêakh, was next invested and captured in spite
of its strong walls. All its inhabitants were put to the sword,
Rahab only being spared to become the founder of a family
in Israel because she had sheltered the Israelitish spies. The
city was razed to the ground, and was not again rebuilt till the
reign of Ahab.</p>

<p class='c003'>We can still trace the site of Jericho in the hollow of the
deep valley through which the Jordan flows into the Dead
Sea. Its ruins lie round about the ’Ain es-Sultân, a spring of
warm water which gushes into an ancient basin, overgrown
with reeds and brushwood, among which the birds flutter and
watch the fish in the water below. Above towers the huge
mass of Mount Qarantel, while the black soil which forms the
floor of the hollow is covered with small artificial mounds of
earth, and is thick with the decayed relics of a tropical vegetation.
In the coldest weather it is still warm at Jericho; in
summer the damp heat is stifling, and the mosquitoes are
innumerable. Now it is given over to idle Bedâwin, but
in the old days when the country was filled with an industrious
population, it was as ‘the garden of the Lord.’ No place in
Palestine was more fertile, and it commanded the ford that led
across the Jordan from the east.</p>

<p class='c003'>The destruction of Jericho opened to Joshua the way into
Canaan. Laden with its spoil, the Israelites matched westward,
up into the mountains and through the pass of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>Michmash towards Beth-el. Beth-el itself was too strong to
be attacked. But a neighbouring town, whose later name of
Ai, ‘the ruined heap,’ was a lasting record of its fate, was not
so fortunate. The Israelites took it by means of an
ambuscade, and the same merciless treatment was dealt out
to it that had been dealt to Jericho. The inhabitants were all
massacred, ‘only the cattle and the spoil Israel took for a prey
unto themselves.’</p>

<p class='c003'>The conquest of Ai, however, had not been easy. The
Canaanites had made a brave defence, and the invaders had
at first suffered a check. The cause was discovered in the
Israelitish camp. A Jew, Achan or Achar, had hidden under
his tent some of the booty of Jericho which ought to have
been either destroyed or dedicated to Yahveh. ‘A goodly
Babylonish garment,’ two hundred shekels of silver, and a
tongue-like wedge of gold fifty shekels in weight, were the
objects which he had coveted and concealed. But the order
had been issued that all objects of metal should be given to
the tabernacle, and that all things else should be burned with
fire. Achan accordingly was condemned to be stoned to
death, and along with him the rest of his family as well as his
oxen, his asses, and his sheep. Then the bodies were burnt,
and a heap of stones piled over them in memory of the event.</p>

<p class='c003'>The mention of the ‘goodly Babylonish garment’ takes us
back to the time when Assyria had not as yet supplanted
Babylonia in the west. For centuries Babylonia had been
the home of weavers and embroiderers whose fabrics were
famous all over the east. The cuneiform tablets contain long
lists of articles of clothing, each of which had its own name;
and, as we learn from the Tel el-Amarna correspondence, the
merchants of Babylonia found a ready market for their goods
in the cities of Canaan. The age of the Exodus marks the
period when the old peaceful intercourse with Babylonia was
coming to an end; alien peoples had barred the road across
the Euphrates, and Babylon itself was about to fall into the
hands of an Assyrian conqueror. Henceforth it was Assyria,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>and not Babylonia, whose name was known or feared in
Palestine, and the writer of a later day would have spoken of
the wares of Assyria rather than those of the Babylonians.<a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c013'><sup>[259]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The destruction of Ai gave Joshua a foothold in the
mountain of Ephraim. Then came the league with the
Gibeonites, secured, so we are told, by craft. Modern criticism,
with needless scepticism, has seen in the narrative
merely a popular legend to account for the fact that the four
cities which formed the western half of the future territory of
Benjamin were laid under tribute, and not destroyed. But the
extermination of the Canaanites was relative, not absolute;
their utter destruction, like that of the Britons by the Saxon
invaders, was the dream of a later day. As we have seen, the
Hebrew occupation of Canaan was a slow and gradual process,
and in the more important cities the older population remained
to the end. Even the temple of Solomon was built on the
threshing-floor of a Jebusite, and the heads of the prisoners
which surmount the names of the places captured by Shishak
in the south of Palestine are Amorite rather than Jewish.
The Amorite population was still predominant there; and the
fellahin of to-day, as has been pointed out by M. Clermont-Ganneau,
are the lineal descendants of the old races.<a id='r260'></a><a href='#f260' class='c013'><sup>[260]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim are not the
only cities of which we hear as having been made tributary.
This was also the case with Megiddo and Taanach, Beth-shean,
Dor, and Ibleam (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 27), as well as with the chief
cities in the territories of Zebulon and Naphtali (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 30,
33); while, on the other hand, the tribe of Issachar became
tributary to its Canaanitish neighbours (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='forty-nine'>xlix.</abbr> 15).<a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c013'><sup>[261]</sup></a> It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>more profitable to exact tribute from a wealthy and industrious
population than to exterminate it, as Mohammed found; and
the near neighbourhood of the central sanctuaries of Israel,
first at Shiloh, then at Jerusalem and Beth-el, afforded a
special reason why the Gibeonites should be made ‘hewers of
wood and drawers of water for the house of God.’</p>

<p class='c003'>The greater part of the future territory of Benjamin was
now in Israelitish hands. The destruction of Jericho had
secured the ford across the Jordan and communication with
the Israelitish settlers on the east side of the river. But it
must be remembered that the tribe of Benjamin as distinct
from that of Ephraim did not as yet exist. Its territory
formed the southern part of Mount Ephraim, and for military
and political purposes the two tribes constituted a single whole.
This was still the case as late as the age of Deborah and
Barak, when the power of Ephraim, ‘behind’ Benjamin, is
said to extend as far as the desert of the Amalekites to the
south of Judah (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v.</abbr> 14). The name of Benjamin, in
fact, means ‘the southerner’; the tribe lay southward of
Ephraim; and the second name by which it was known—that
of Ben-Oni, ‘the Onite’—indicated that it was settled
round the great sanctuary of Beth-On. And such indeed was
the case when the tribe had vindicated its individual existence
and been definitely separated from Ephraim. Beth-On or
Beth-el was then included within its boundaries (<abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='eighteen'>xviii.</abbr>
22). Originally, however, Beth-el belonged to Ephraim, and
had been an Ephraimitish conquest (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 22-26).</p>

<p class='c003'>The conquest of Beth-el did not take place until after
Joshua’s death, and as long as it remained independent it
must have been a constant menace to the Israelitish settlers
in Mount Ephraim. With its capture all danger passed away,
and Mount Ephraim—the heart of Palestine—became at last
the secure possession of the ‘house of Joseph.’ From hence,
as from an impregnable fortress, they were able to make
descents upon the fertile lands to the west and attack the cities
which stood there. The powerful city of Gezer was eventually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>compelled to pay them tribute (<abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='sixteen'>xvi.</abbr> 10), and the territory
which had been assigned to Dan became tributary to ‘the
house of Joseph’ (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 35).</p>

<p class='c003'>But all this was after Joshua had passed away. Besides
crossing the Jordan and securing a footing in Mount Ephraim,
Joshua had made a successful raid into those mountains in
the ‘Negeb’ of Judah which had been so fatal to the first
Israelitish invaders of Canaan. The destruction of Ai had
excited the fears of Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem, and in the
league that had been made between Gibeon and the invaders
he saw danger to his own state. Gibeon lay only a few miles
to the north of Jerusalem, and the Tel el-Amarna tablets have
shown us that the neighbourhood of two Canaanitish cities
was a quite sufficient cause of war between them. When
the tablets were written, Ebed-Tob was king of Jerusalem, and
his letters to the Pharaoh are filled with imploring appeals for
help against his enemies. These were partly the neighbouring
‘governors,’ partly the Khabiri or ‘Confederates,’ who
seem to have been of foreign origin, and who had already
captured some of his cities. The situation, therefore, was
very much like what it was in the later days of Adoni-zedek,
the place of the Egyptian ‘governors’ being taken by Gibeon,
while the Khabiri were represented by the Israelites. But
Adoni-zedek had no suzerain lord in Egypt to whom he could
apply for aid. He was therefore forced to turn to the
Canaanitish princes around him and form a league with them
against the invading hordes from the desert. Hoham of
Hebron, Piram of Jarmuth, Yaphia of Lachish, and Debir of
Eglon rallied to his summons, and the combined forces
marched against Gibeon and besieged the town.<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c013'><sup>[262]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Gibeonites at once sent messengers to Joshua, who accordingly
left the camp at Gilgal and fell suddenly on the besieging
army. The Canaanites were utterly routed, and fled towards
Beth-horon and Makkedah, a hailstorm adding to their discomfiture.
The five kings were discovered hiding in a cave
at Makkedah, and dragged before Joshua, who pitilessly put
them all to death. The bodies were buried in the cave and
great stones laid upon its mouth, which, the compiler of
the book of Joshua states, remained there unto his day
(<abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'>x.</abbr> 27).</p>

<p class='c003'>The defeat of the Canaanite army was followed by the
capture of Makkedah and Libnah, which opened the road to
Lachish. The site of Lachish was rediscovered by Professor
Flinders Petrie in 1890 at Tell el-Hesy, sixteen miles eastward
of Gaza. The great mound that covers its ruins has been
excavated partly by him, partly by Dr. Bliss, and the huge
wall that surrounded it in the days of the Amorites, and
before which the Israelites encamped, has been explored and
measured.<a id='r263'></a><a href='#f263' class='c013'><sup>[263]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The city stood on a natural eminence some forty feet in
height. Close to it rises the only good spring of water in the
district, which when swollen by the winter rains becomes the
torrent of the Hesy. The stream ran past the eastern side of
the city, and has eaten away part of the remains of the successive
cities which rose upon the site, one above the ruins of
the other. Fragments of the pottery used by the Amorite
defenders of the city in the days of Joshua can now be seen
in the rooms of the Palestine Exploration Fund.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>The walls of Lachish, like those of the cities of Egypt, were
built of crude brick, and were nearly thirty feet in thickness.
It had, in fact, long been one of the principal fortresses of
Southern Palestine. Among the Tel el-Amarna tablets are
letters from two of its governors Zimrida and Yabniel, the first
of whom was murdered, and who is mentioned on another
tablet found by Dr. Bliss among the ruins of Lachish itself.
Its capture, therefore, by the Israelites was a serious blow to
the Canaanites in the southern part of the country. But,
though Horam king of Gezer came to its assistance, all was
no avail; the strong fortress fell at last before the invaders,
and ‘all the souls’ that were in it were massacred.<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c013'><sup>[264]</sup></a> For at
least a century its site lay desolate and uninhabited; and the
explorers found in the soil that accumulated above the ruins
of the Amorite city nothing but the ashes of the camp-fires of
Bedâwin nomads.</p>

<p class='c003'>Eglon, now probably Tell Ejlân, close to Tell el-Hesy,
naturally shared the fate of the neighbouring city. According
to the compiler of the book of Joshua, the fall of Hebron and
Debir followed immediately after that of Eglon. But this
cannot be correct. Debir, as we afterwards learn, was taken
at a later date by Othniel (<abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 16, 17; <abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 12, 13),
not by Joshua, and the error seems to have been due to the
fact that Debir was the name of the king of Eglon. It was the
king and not the town of that name who fell before the arms
of Joshua.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is, moreover, difficult to reconcile the statement that
Hebron was captured by Joshua after the defeat of the five kings
with the narrative of its capture by Caleb, which is given in detail
elsewhere (<abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 13, 14; <abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 9, 10). Here, as in other
parts of the book of Joshua, we find a tendency to ascribe the
gradual occupation of Canaan to a single point of time, and to
assign all the successive conquests made in it by the Israelites
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>to the general who first led them across the Jordan. The
individual hero has absorbed all the victories gained by his
people, and the past has been foreshortened in the retrospect
of the later historian. As in the books of Kings the murder of
Sennacherib is made to follow immediately after his flight from
Judah twenty years before, so in the book of Joshua, the conquest
of Canaan is all placed in one age, the lifetime of the
hero himself. As Moses was the lawgiver of Israel and its
deliverer from the house of bondage, posterity saw in his
successor the conqueror of Canaan.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is noticeable, however, that neither Jerusalem nor Gezer
is said to have been taken after the battle of Makkedah.
Both cities were doubtless too strong to be attacked; and
though Gezer was subsequently forced to become the vassal
of Ephraim, Jerusalem was destined to fall before a Jewish
and not an Ephraimitish leader.</p>

<p class='c003'>The battle of Makkedah became the subject of a national
song. It was embodied, like David’s dirge over Saul and
Jonathan, in the book of Jashar, a fragment of which is
quoted by the compiler of the book of Joshua. ‘Sun, be thou
still upon Gibeon, and thou, moon, in the valley of Ajalon!’
cried Joshua, ‘in the sight of Israel,’ ‘when the Lord delivered
up the Amorites’ before them: ‘and the sun was still, and the
moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon
their enemies.’ So ran the words of the poem, and the prose
historian seems to have taken them literally.</p>

<p class='c003'>The alliance with Gibeon and the destruction of Lachish
opened the way to the south. Westward, the sea-coast was
in the hands of the Philistines, whom the Israelites would
have found more formidable enemies than the disunited and
effeminate Canaanites. The five Philistine cities, accordingly,
which had been but recently wrested from Egyptian hands,
were left untouched, and the Israelitish raiders made their way
into the Negeb towards the south-east, where they succeeded
in penetrating as far as Arad and Zephath. They had thus
reached the very spot where the first attempt to invade Canaan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>had failed, and from which the disappointed tribes had been
driven back again into the wilderness. Zephath was not far
distant from Kadesh-barnea, so that it is with a pardonable exaggeration
that the Jewish historian describes Joshua as smiting
his enemies ‘from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza’ (<abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'>x.</abbr> 41).</p>

<p class='c003'>It is true that his victories in this part of Canaan have been
questioned. No detailed account is given of them, and it is
only in the list of the ‘kings’ who were overthrown by ‘Joshua
and the children of Israel’ on the western side of the Jordan
that the names of Arad and Zephath, or Hormah, appear
(<abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='twelve'>xii.</abbr> 14). Moreover, we are told in the book of Judges
(<abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 17) that Zephath was destroyed by Judah and Simeon
after the death of the Ephraimitish leader (<abbr title='verse'><i>v.</i></abbr> 1), a memorial
of the destruction being preserved in the change of name to
Hormah. But it must be noted that it is only the ‘kings’ of
Arad and Zephath who are said to have been ‘smitten’ by
Joshua, not the cities over which they ruled. The expedition
to the Negeb was merely a raid, such as the possession of
Lachish and the mountainous country to the north-west of it
enabled the Israelitish chieftain to make with impunity.
Indeed, such raids into the fertile land to the south would
have been natural, if not inevitable.</p>

<p class='c003'>No detailed account was preserved of them, since they were
connected with no striking and important event, like the
capture and destruction of a Canaanitish city. The four
military deeds with which history associated the name of
Joshua centered each of them round the overthrow of a
Canaanitish stronghold and gave the Israelites the command
of the surrounding country. They were campaigns which led
to the permanent possession of territory, not mere raids or
barren victories. The capture of Jericho secured the passage
across the Jordan, that of Ai planted Ephraim and Benjamin
in the mountains of central Palestine, the destruction of
Lachish opened up communication with that desert of the
south in which the Israelites had received the legislation of
Kadesh-barnea, while the overthrow of the king of Hazor gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>them a foothold in the north. The alliance with the Gibeonites
was of equal importance, for it secured friends and allies in
the very heart of the enemy’s country, and its firstfruits were
the victory at Makkedah and the destruction of Lachish.
Jericho, Ai, Lachish, Hazor, and Gibeon,—these were the
names which guaranteed to Joshua his claim to have been
the conqueror of Canaan.</p>

<p class='c003'>The victory at Hazor seems to have been his last. Hazor
stood near Kadesh of Galilee, now represented by the ruins of
Qedes, to the north of Safed, and on the western side of the
marshes of Hûleh, the Lake Merom of the Old Testament.<a id='r265'></a><a href='#f265' class='c013'><sup>[265]</sup></a> In
the age of the Tel el-Amarna letters it was still governed by its
native kings, and in one of them an Egyptian officer complains
that the king had joined with Sidon in intriguing with the
Bedâwin.<a id='r266'></a><a href='#f266' class='c013'><sup>[266]</sup></a> When the Israelites entered Palestine it was the
leading city of the northern part of the country. While
Megiddo was the capital of the centre of the country, Hazor
was the capital of the north. Its king, Jabin, now put himself
at the head of a great confederacy which extended from
Sidon to Dor on the sea-coast, and from the slopes of Hermon
to the Sea of Galilee in the inland region. Among the confederates
history remembered the names of Jobab, the king of
Madon, and the kings of Shimron and Achshaph. Achshaph is
the Phœnician Ekdippa, now Zîb, on the sea-coast, which is
called Aksap by Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> But Madon is written Marôn
in the Septuagint, though the reading of the Hebrew text
seems to be confirmed by the modern name of Khurbet
Madîn, ‘the ruins of Madîn.’ Shimron, moreover, is Symoôn
in the Septuagint, and this form of the name finds support
in the Simônias of Josephus, Simonia in the Talmud, now
Semûnieh, sixteen miles from Khurbet Madîn. Mr. Tomkins
would identify it with the Shmânau of Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr><a id='r267'></a><a href='#f267' class='c013'><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>But, again, the reading of the Hebrew text is probably the
more correct. In what may be termed the official list of
Joshua’s victories (<abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='twelve'>xii.</abbr> 20), the name appears as Shimronmeron,
and this reminds us of Samsi-muruna (‘the Sun-god is
lord’), which is given by the Assyrian inscriptions as the
name of a town in this very neighbourhood. It was from
‘Menahem, king of Samsi-muruna,’ that Sennacherib received
tribute during his campaign against Hezekiah, and it is
possible that Shimron may be a contracted form of Shem[esh-me]ron
or Sam[si-mu]runa.</p>

<p class='c003'>Once more criticism has raised doubts as to the truth of the
narrative. We hear of another Jabin of Hazor, at a later date,
in the time of Deborah and Barak, and we hear also of
another great victory gained by Israel over Jabin’s troops. It
is urged that if Hazor had been burnt to the ground by
Joshua, and all its inhabitants put to the sword, it could
hardly have risen so soon again from its ashes and have
assumed a leading position in the north. Had Joshua’s
conquest been as complete as it is represented to have been,
the country would have been Israelitish, and not Canaanite.</p>

<p class='c003'>But it does not follow that because there was one king of
Hazor called Jabin, there should not have been another of the
same name. Such repetitions of name have been common in
other countries of the world, and it is difficult to see why the
rulers of Hazor should not be allowed a similar privilege.
That a city should rise from its ruins and recover its former
power is again no unique event. Much depends upon its
position and the character of its inhabitants. We gather from
the Egyptian annals that the towns of Canaan were accustomed
to capture and temporary destruction. But they soon recovered
themselves, the old population flocked back, and their
ruined walls were again repaired.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is true that the conquest of the country by Joshua could
not have been as thorough as the narrative describes. But
that we already knew from the first chapter of Judges (<abbr title='verses'>vv.</abbr> 30-33).
Oriental expressions and modes of thought are not to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>measured by the precise terminology of the modern West, and
an Eastern writer speaks absolutely where we should speak
relatively. When it is said that ‘all the earth sought to
Solomon, to hear his wisdom’ (1 Kings <abbr title='ten'>x.</abbr> 24), the universality
of the statement must be very considerably limited, and so too
when it is said that ‘Joshua took all that land’ (<abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='eleven'>xi.</abbr> 16),
the expression admits of a similarly liberal discount. In fact,
the narrative itself contains its own corrective. The words, ‘All
the cities of those kings ... did Joshua take, and smote them
with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them’ (<abbr title='verse'>ver.</abbr> 12),
are followed immediately by the conditioning clause, ‘Only
the cities which were built upon <i>tels</i>, Israel burned none of
them: Hazor alone did Joshua burn.’</p>

<p class='c003'>Between the story of Joshua’s campaign and that of the
rising under Barak there is no resemblance whatever. In the
time of the Hebrew judge the army of Jabin was commanded
by Sisera, not by Jabin himself. The decisive battle took
place on the banks of the Kishon, not on the shores of Lake
Hûleh, miles away to the north, and the city of Hazor was
neither captured nor destroyed. Kadesh of Galilee and other
districts were already in the hands of the Israelites, and must
therefore have been occupied by them at some earlier period.
The account in the book of Joshua, brief as it is, tells us when
the occupation took place.</p>

<p class='c003'>Jabin had summoned his allies and vassals to oppose the
northward march of the Israelites. The Canaanites stood
upon the defensive, and the Israelites therefore must have
been the attacking party. That they did not cross the Jordan
from the plains of Bashan we may gather from the list of the
kings vanquished by Joshua.<a id='r268'></a><a href='#f268' class='c013'><sup>[268]</sup></a> Among them we find the kings
of Taanach and Megiddo, Kadesh of Naphtali and Jokneam,
Dor, Gilgal, and Tirzah.<a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c013'><sup>[269]</sup></a> Tirzah would have been the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>stage northward of Shechem; the fortress of Megiddo commanded
the plain of Jezreel. A common danger would thus
have forced the kings of the centre and the north of Canaan
to fight together, and the confederacy would have covered
much the same extent of territory as that which confronted
Barak on the banks of the Kishon. But instead of advancing
upon the enemy from the north, as was the case with Barak,
Joshua would have moved up from the south.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was on the shore of Lake Merom that the Israelites fell
suddenly upon the Canaanitish encampment. The Canaanites
were taken by surprise and fled in all directions. Some made
their way across the narrow gorge of the Jordan towards
Mizpeh of Gilead;<a id='r270'></a><a href='#f270' class='c013'><sup>[270]</sup></a> the larger body was pursued as far as
Sidon, where they at last found a shelter behind the strong
walls of the city. The chariots of their cavalry, useless to
mountaineers, were burned, and their horses were maimed. The
flight of the army had left Hazor undefended; the Israelites
accordingly turned back from the pursuit, and took the city by
assault. Its houses were burned, its spoil carried away, and
‘every man’ was smitten with the edge of the sword, ‘neither
left they any to breathe.’ The merciless ferocity of Joshua
finds a close parallel in that of the Assyrian kings.</p>

<p class='c003'>The life of Joshua was drawing to an end. He was an old
man; it was said he was 110 years of age at his death, the
length of time the Egyptian wished his friends to live. He
had brought his people into the Promised Land, had shown
them how to take cities and defeat their adversaries, and had
planted Israel firmly in the mountainous part of Canaan.
Before his death the tribes were provisionally established in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>the territories subsequently called after their names. We are
not bound to believe that the division of the land was made
with the mathematical precision which had become possible in
the days of the compiler of the book of Joshua, but to deny
that it was made at all is merely an abuse of criticism. In the
period of the Judges we find most of the tribes actually settled
in the very districts which we are told were given to them, and
the fact that in one or two instances—Dan and Simeon, for
example—the tribe never gained possession of the larger part
of the territory said to have been assigned to it, shows that the
story of the division could not have been based on the later
geographical position of the tribes. The doctrine of development
may have no limitations in the domain of organic nature,
but history has to take account of individual action and the
arbitrary enactments of great men. To suppose that the tribal
division of Palestine was the result of a process of development
has little in support of it, and fails to explain the
geographical position traditionally assigned to a tribe like Dan.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was one tribe, however, to whose history the theory
of development is to some extent applicable. This was the
tribe of Judah. The tribe was only partly of Israelitish descent.
Its most important family, that of Caleb and Othniel, belonged
to the Edomite tribe of Kenaz; while another Edomite tribe,
that of Jerahmeel, occupied the southern part of the Jewish
territory (1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii.</abbr> 25-33, 42). Even ‘the families of the
scribes which dwelt at Jabez’ were Kenites from Midian
(1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii.</abbr> 55).<a id='r271'></a><a href='#f271' class='c013'><sup>[271]</sup></a> Down to the time of the kings the Israelitish
members of the tribe of Judah mixed freely with their
neighbours; David himself was descended from Ruth the
Moabitess, and Bath-sheba, the mother of his successor, had
been the wife of a Hittite. As has been already noticed, the
prisoners whose figures surmount the names of Shishak’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>conquests in Judah have the features of the Amorite and not
of the Jew. In the Song of Deborah the tribe of Judah, like
those of Dan and Simeon, is unknown. It is Ephraim and
Benjamin who form the Israelitish vanguard against the
Amalekites of the southern desert. And the deliverers of
southern Israel from its two first oppressors were Othniel the
Kenizzite and Ehud the Benjamite.</p>

<p class='c003'>The tribe of Judah as a compact and definite whole first
makes its appearance at a later period, and, unlike the other
tribes of Israel, represents a geographical rather than an ethnographical
unity.<a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c013'><sup>[272]</sup></a> Jews were commingled in it with Edomites,
as well as with other tribes—Dan, Simeon, and Levi. Its cities
were only partly Israelitish; even the future capital, Jerusalem,
retained its Jebusite population, and the temple was built on
land that had been bought from a Gentile owner.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nevertheless, the fact that both tribe and territory bore to
the last the name of Judah indicates that in this mixture of
nationalities the Hebrew element remained the stronger and
more predominant. It is true that Hebron, the first centre
and capital of Judah, had been conquered, not by a Jew, but
by the Kenizzite Caleb, and that his brother Othniel was the
first ‘Judge’; but it is also true that the settlement of the
country was in the main due to an amalgamation of Hebrew
and Edomite elements. Gedor, Socho, Zanoah, Keilah, and
Eshtemoa traced their second foundation to a Kenizzite father
and a Jewish mother (1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 18, 19), and Hebron itself
soon ceased to be distinctively Kenizzite and became Jewish.</p>

<p class='c003'>Caleb the Kenizzite had been one of the spies sent out from
Kadesh-barnea when the Israelites made their first, and unsuccessful,
attempt to invade Canaan. He consequently
belonged to the generation which had escaped from the
bondage of Egypt, of which he and Joshua were said to have
been the only survivors at the time of the passage of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>Jordan. Hebron had been the chief point and goal of exploration
on the part of the spies, and it was from its neighbourhood
that the grapes were brought which testified to the fertility of
the land. It was natural, therefore, that Hebron should again
be the object of Caleb’s aim, and that while the Ephraimitish
general was establishing himself in the north Caleb should
lead his followers to its assault. The destruction of Lachish
had opened the way; and the steep path which led up the
limestone hills from Lachish to Hebron was left undefended.</p>

<p class='c003'>Modern writers have seen in the name of Caleb a mere
tribal designation denoting the ‘Calebites’ or ‘Dog-men.’
But the cuneiform inscriptions show us that Caleb or ‘Dog’
was the name of an individual, and they also explain how it
came to be so. In the Tel el-Amarna tablets, as well as
in later Assyrian letters, the word <i>Kalbu</i> or ‘Dog’ is used
in the sense of ‘officer’ or ‘messenger’; the king’s officer
was his ‘faithful dog,’ and the term was an honourable one.<a id='r273'></a><a href='#f273' class='c013'><sup>[273]</sup></a>
It conveyed none of those ideas of contempt or abuse with
which it was afterwards associated in the Semitic mind, and
which may have had their origin in Arabia. It is possible
that Caleb had been an ‘officer’ of the Pharaoh before he
became a Hebrew spy.</p>

<p class='c003'>The capture of Hebron is said to have taken place five years
after the passage of the Jordan (<abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 10). At any rate,
it was before the death of Joshua (notwithstanding <abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 1,
10). It was after that event, however, that the further conquests
of the Kenizzites were made.</p>

<p class='c003'>Somewhere near Hebron, but higher in ‘the mountains,’
was the Canaanitish city of Debir. Debir signified the
‘Sanctuary’; and it was here, as in Babylonia and Assyria, that
a great library of books was stored in one of the chambers of
the temple. Like the Babylonian cities, moreover, Debir had
more than one name. It was also called Kirjath-Sannah, ‘the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>city of Instruction,’ from the schools which gathered round its
library,<a id='r274'></a><a href='#f274' class='c013'><sup>[274]</sup></a> and in the Old Testament it is further known as
Kirjath-Sepher or ‘Booktown.’ In <i>The Travels of the Mohar</i>,
however, a satirical account of a tourist’s adventures in Palestine,
which was written by an Egyptian in the reign of
Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>, it is termed Beth-Sopher, ‘the house of the
scribe,’ and is coupled with Kirjath-Anab. It is plain, therefore,
that the Massoretic punctuation Sepher ‘book’ is erroneous, and
must be corrected to Sopher or ‘scribe.’ Whether Kirjath,
‘city,’ should also be corrected into Beth, ‘house’ or ‘temple,’
is more doubtful. <i>Beth</i> would be the more appropriate term
in the case of a town which possessed a sanctuary, and it
may be that the word Kirjath has been derived from the
neighbouring town of [Kirjath-] Anab, which is called simply
Anab in <abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 50. But it is also possible that the Egyptian
writer has made a mistake, and has interchanged the words
‘city’ and ‘house,’ the true names of the two cities having
been Kirjath-Sopher and Beth-Anab.<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c013'><sup>[275]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>However this may be, Caleb promised his daughter Achsah
as a reward to the conqueror of Debir. The prize was won
by his ‘younger brother’ Othniel, and the Canaanitish city
was so completely destroyed that its very site is still unknown.
Its library perished in the ruins, though the clay tablets with
which it was doubtless filled must still be lying beneath the
soil, awaiting the discoverer who shall with their aid reconstruct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>the ancient history of southern Canaan. Hebron was
more fortunate. The city was spared after its capture, and
became the chief seat of the Kenizzites, and subsequently,
when the Kenizzites were merged in Judah, the capital of
Judah itself.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Hebrew tribe of Judah was slow in following the example
of its Edomite comrades. The ‘children of Judah,’ it is said,
had at first been content to live with the Midianitish Kenites in
the neighbourhood of Jericho, and when the Kenites returned
to the desert of Kadesh-barnea to settle there along with them
(<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 16). But there were other Jews who remained
behind in Canaan, and there carved out a patrimony for
themselves. Judah and Simeon, we are told, ‘went up’
together into the country which had been allotted to them,
and eventually succeeded in occupying the greater part of it.
The expression is a curious one, and seems to imply that the
invaders started from the desert of Kadesh-barnea, though
Lachish and its neighbourhood may be meant. At all events,
Adoni-bezek, ‘the lord of Bezek,’ was defeated and captured,
and his thumbs and great toes cut off, like those of the seventy
vassal princes who had ‘picked up their meat’ under his own
table. It is added that he was brought to Jerusalem, where
he died.</p>

<p class='c003'>That he was brought there by the Hebrews is not certain.
However, the compiler of the book of Judges seems to have
thought so, as he goes on to say, ‘And the children of Judah
fought<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c013'><sup>[276]</sup></a> against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the
edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.’ It is difficult to
reconcile this with the very definite statement in the book of
Joshua (<abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 63), ‘As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
the children of Judah could not drive them out: but
the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem
unto this day’; or with the equally explicit statement in the
first chapter of Judges itself (verse 21), ‘The children of Benjamin
did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in
Jerusalem unto this day.’<a id='r277'></a><a href='#f277' class='c013'><sup>[277]</sup></a> The latter passage belongs to the
period when Judah had not yet become a corporate whole,
and when, therefore, as in the Song of Deborah, Benjamin
was still regarded as forming the southern boundary of the
tribes of Israel; but the first passage takes us down to the
time when Benjamin had been supplanted by Judah, and
Israel was being prepared to receive a king. It was during
the earlier period that the Levite of Mount Ephraim, when
returning from Beth-lehem, would not lodge in ‘Jebus’
because it was a ‘city of the Jebusites’ (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='nineteen'>xix.</abbr> 10, 11);
the later period extended to the time when Jerusalem was
taken by David, and when the Jewish king, so far from
massacring its inhabitants and setting it on fire, allowed the
Jebusites in it to retain their property (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-four'>xxiv.</abbr> 18-24),
and made it the capital of his empire. Doubtless Jerusalem
might have been captured by the ‘children of Judah,’ and
nevertheless have continued to exist. We may gather from
the Tel el-Amarna tablets that such an occurrence actually
took place at the close of the eighteenth Egyptian dynasty,
and one of the cities of southern Canaan taken by Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>
was Shalama or Salem. But if so, there could have been no
massacre of the population and burning of the town; the
passages of the Old Testament which describe the Jebusites
as living uninterruptedly in their city are too clear and definite
to admit of such a supposition. On the contrary, the Jebusites
lived in peace and harmony along with both Jews and Benjamites;
and were it not for the words of the Levite (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr>
<abbr title='nineteen'>xix.</abbr> 11), that Jerusalem was still ‘the city of a stranger,’ we
could well believe that the fate which overtook it in the time
of David had been anticipated in an earlier century. But
neither Benjamin nor Judah could ‘drive out the Jebusites
that inhabited’ the great fortress-city of Southern Palestine.</p>

<p class='c003'>The rise of Judah dated from the overthrow of Adoni-bezek,
‘Afterwards,’ we read, ‘the children of Judah went down to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>fight against the Canaanites that dwelt in the mountain, and
in the Negeb of the south, and in the plain.’ It was all long
subsequent to the death both of Joshua and of Caleb. The
last survivors of the first attempt to penetrate into that part of
Canaan had passed away before it at last fell—if only partially—into
Israelitish hands. The first dreams of conquest had
long since made way for a sober and disappointing reality.
Canaan had proved for Israel a more difficult prize to secure
than Britain proved for the Saxons. It was only in the
mountains and a few isolated cities that the invaders succeeded
in holding their own. Elsewhere the walls and chariots of
the Canaanites kept them at bay, while the strongholds of the
Philistines and Phœnicians barred them from the coast. The
children of Israel were compelled to dwell ‘among the
Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites,
and Jebusites,’ and there was little cause for wonder that
‘they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their
daughters to their sons, and served their gods’ (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 5, 6).</p>

<p class='c003'>Before Joshua died the tabernacle was set up at Shiloh, on
the slopes of Mount Ephraim, in the heart of the newly-conquered
land. That the central sanctuary should thus be
under the protection of Ephraim was a token that ‘the house
of Joseph’ was paramount among the tribes of Israel. A
further token was the burial of the mummy of Joseph at
Shechem. Here, too, at Shechem were the two mountains
Ebal and Gerizim, on which the curses and the blessings of the
Law had been ordered to be pronounced. History has left no
record of the conquest of the place, and the name of the king of
Shechem is not even found in the list of the kings vanquished by
Joshua. But the city must have fallen during the early period
of the invasion, and the narrative in <abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 33 would imply
that its capture followed closely upon the destruction of Ai.</p>

<p class='c003'>We may gather from the silence of history that there was
neither siege nor massacre to make an impression on the
memory of posterity. And the inference is confirmed by what
we know of the subsequent history of Shechem. In the time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>of Gideon and Abimelech its population was still half-Amorite
(<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='nine'>ix.</abbr> 28). As at Jerusalem, the older inhabitants cannot
have been destroyed or driven out. Like the Gibeonites, they
must have made terms with the invaders, or mixed peaceably
with them in the course of years.</p>

<p class='c003'>At the outset, however, Shechem would have been the
capital of Ephraim. Here was the sepulchre of the founder of
‘the house of Joseph,’ here were the two sacred mountains of
the Law, and here, too, it was that Joshua gathered the people
together to hear his last words. Like Moses at Sinai and
Kadesh-barnea, ‘Joshua made a covenant with the people ...
and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. And
Joshua wrote these words in the book of the Law of God, and
took a great stone, and set it up there under the terebinth
that was in the sanctuary of the Lord.’ Here, therefore, was
the local sanctuary of Ephraim, separate from the central one
at Shiloh, and a sacred terebinth stood within its precincts.
Criticism finds no reason to doubt that ‘the great stone’
spoken of in the text was actually set up, like a ‘Beth-el,’ under
the shadow of the tree, and it is hard to see why it should be
more sceptical towards the further statement that the covenant
which the stone commemorated was written by Joshua ‘in the
book of the Law of God.’</p>

<p class='c003'>While Shechem was thus the local sanctuary of Ephraim,
the tribes east of the Jordan had consecrated a ‘great altar’
of their own on the banks of the river. The altar was the
occasion of a dispute between the two branches of the house
of Israel, which nearly resulted in war. But the danger was
averted through the mediation of the priests; and although the
tribes east and west of the Jordan necessarily had different
interests, it was long ere this led to open hostility, or even
to forgetfulness of their common ancestry and common God.
Deborah reproaches Reuben and Gilead for having stood
aloof while Zebulon and Naphtali were hazarding their lives in
the field, and the son of Gideon had his kingdom on the
eastern side of the Jordan.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Joshua was buried at Timnath-serah or Timnath-heres<a id='r278'></a><a href='#f278' class='c013'><sup>[278]</sup></a> in
Mount Ephraim, in a piece of ground which had become
the property of himself and his family. The Israelites of a
later day looked back upon his memory with gratitude and
veneration; he had been the hero who had succeeded in
doing what Moses had failed to accomplish, and had led his
people into the Promised Land. But history judges somewhat
differently. He was not a lawgiver or a leader of men like
Moses, and even from a military point of view the conquest of
the Amorite kingdoms of Sihon and Og was a greater achievement
than securing a foothold in the mountains of central
Palestine. Joshua was not the conqueror of Canaan, as the
pious imagination of a later age supposed him to be: he
merely opened the way to it. He taught the Israelites how to
defeat the Canaanites, and he succeeded in destroying a few
of their cities. But that was all; and the wholesale massacres
which marked his progress, the wanton destruction of everything
which could not be carried away as spoil, and the barbaric
extermination of the elements of culture, find their match
only in the sanguinary campaigns of some of the Assyrian
kings and the Saxon invasion of Britain.</p>

<p class='c004'>Israel has at last forced its way into the Promised Land.
Mount Ephraim is in its hands, and it has already planted
itself in other parts of Palestine. Joshua, the leader who
taught it how to cross the Jordan and defeat the princes of
Canaan, is dead. The age of wandering is over; the age of
settlement has begun.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the age of settlement was a stormy one. The Canaanites
were but partially subdued; the Israelites themselves were
little better than a collection of raiding bands. They had
brought with them, moreover, the nomadic habits of the
desert, and were but little inclined to rebuild the cities which
they had so ruthlessly destroyed. And in almost every direction
they were encircled by enemies, better organised, better
armed, or more numerous than themselves, who from time to
time succeeded in overrunning their fields and reducing them
to subjection. The tribes who had dreamed of conquering
Canaan found themselves, instead, the prey of others.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was a period of anarchy and perpetual war. Without a
head, and without cohesion, it seems strange that they did
not perish utterly or become absorbed by the older population
of the land. That the nation should have survived
admits of only one explanation. It possessed a common
faith, a common sanctuary, and a common code of sacred
laws. As in Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire the
Church preserved the fabric of society, and eventually brought
order out of chaos, so, too, in ancient Israel, the nation owed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>its continued existence to the law which had been given by
Moses. Only the iron fetters of a written law, with its
organised priesthood and sanctions, and, above all, the knowledge
that it existed, could have prevented the process of
political and social disintegration from rapidly running its
course. Had the religion of Israel been merely that result
of evolution which is dreamed of by some modern writers,
and the law of Moses the invention of a later age, there would
have been no Israel in which a religion could have developed,
or a code of laws have been compiled. The outward unity of
the tribes in Egypt and the desert was shattered by the settlement
in Canaan, and all that remained was the inward and
religious unity that had been forced upon them by the genius
of an individual legislator. The place of the political head
and leader was supplied by the organised cult and elaborate
code of laws which he had bequeathed to the nation. To all
external appearance, indeed, Israel had ceased to be a nation,
and had been reduced to a scattered and anarchical collection
of marauding tribes; but the elements which could again bind
them together still existed—the belief in the same national
God, the rites with which He was worshipped, and the
priesthood and sanctuary where the tradition of the law was
preserved.</p>

<p class='c003'>That this is no imaginary picture is proved by the Song of
Deborah. The Song is admitted by the most sceptical of
critics to belong to the age to which it is assigned, and consequently
to reflect the ideas of the Israelite shortly after the
settlement in Canaan. No composition of the Exilic period
could be more uncompromising in its monotheism, and its
assertion that Yahveh alone is the God of Israel. And the
Song further assumes that the tribes of Israel, disunited though
they otherwise may be, are nevertheless bound together by
a common faith in the one national God. Nor is this
all. Israel still possesses, even among its northern tribes,
‘legislators’ like Moses, and scribes who handle the pen
(<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v.</abbr> 14). Writing, therefore, is still known and practised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>even among a people so oppressed by their enemies that ‘the
highways were unoccupied,’ and the fellahin of the villages
had ceased to exist. Laws, too, were still promulgated in
continuation of the laws of Moses, and the people of Israel
are ‘the people of the Lord.’</p>

<p class='c003'>And yet there was another side to the picture. While
Zebulon and Naphtali were hazarding ‘their lives unto the
death’ ‘on behalf of Yahveh,’ there were tribes and cities
which forgot their duty to their God and their brethren, and
‘came not to the help of the Lord.’ Such was the case with
the inhabitants of Meroz; such, too, was the conduct of
Reuben and Gilead, of Dan and Asher. The description
given by the compiler of the Book of Judges of the condition
of the tribes after the death of Joshua cannot be far from the
truth. They were planted in the midst of enemies whom they
had found too strong to be destroyed or driven out. On all
sides of them were ‘the Philistines, and all the Canaanites,
and the Sidonians, and the Hittites that dwelt in Mount
Lebanon from Mount Baal-Hermon unto the entering in of
Hamath.’<a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c013'><sup>[279]</sup></a> ‘And the children of Israel,’ we are told, dwelt
among them, and ‘took their daughters to be their wives, and
gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord,
and forgot the Lord their God and served the Baals and the
Ashêrahs.’<a id='r280'></a><a href='#f280' class='c013'><sup>[280]</sup></a> Even more expressive are the words with which
the Book of Judges ends: ‘In those days there was no king
in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes.’
It was an age of individual lawlessness; the bands of society
were unloosed, and none was strong enough to lead and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>control. Outside the influence of the representatives of the
Mosaic law there was neither curb nor order.</p>

<p class='c003'>Two incidents have been recorded which throw a lurid light
on the manners and character of the age which immediately
followed the settlement in Canaan. In one of them we hear
of a Levite of Mount Ephraim ‘who took to him a concubine
out of Beth-lehem in Judah.’ Phinehas, the grandson of
Aaron, had succeeded his father Eleazar as high-priest at
Shiloh (<abbr title='Judges'>Judg.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty'>xx.</abbr> 28), where ‘the ark of the covenant’ had
been placed. The concubine proved unfaithful to the Levite,
and eventually fled to her father’s house in Beth-lehem.
Thither the Levite followed her, and persuaded her to return
with him to his home. The woman’s father, however, highly
pleased at the reconciliation, continued to press his hospitality
upon his guest, and it was not until the afternoon of the fifth
day that the Levite succeeded in getting away. The evening
soon fell upon him, and, rejecting the advice of his slave that
he should spend the night in Jerusalem, on the ground that
it was ‘the city of a stranger,’ he pressed on with his concubine
to Gibeah, which belonged to Benjamin. It had been better
for him, however, to have sought hospitality from ‘the stranger’
rather than from his own people; for, in spite of the fact that
he had with him food in plenty both for himself and for his
asses, he was left to spend the night in the street. But at the
last moment an old man, who was not a native of Gibeah,
came in from his work in the fields, and seeing the Levite in
the street, asked him and his companions into the house.
While they were eating and drinking, the rabble gathered
about the house and demanded that the man should be
brought out to them that they might ‘know him.’ It was a
repetition of the scene enacted in Sodom when the angels
visited the house of Lot, with the difference that the actors
were Israelites instead of Canaanites, whom the Hebrews had
been called upon to destroy for their sins. In vain ‘the
master of the house’ intreated his fellow-townsmen not to
act ‘so wickedly,’ offering them his own daughter as well as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>his guest’s concubine in place of the guest himself. Finally,
however, they were satisfied with the unfortunate concubine,
whom they ‘abused’ all night, and then left dead on the doorstep
of the house. The first thing ‘her lord’ saw when he
opened the door in the morning was the woman’s corpse.
This he placed on his ass and carried to his home, where he
divided it into twelve pieces, which he sent ‘into all the coasts
of Israel.’<a id='r281'></a><a href='#f281' class='c013'><sup>[281]</sup></a> The horror of the deed, or perhaps of the visible
proofs with which it was announced, aroused the Israelites, and
they demanded the punishment of the guilty. The crime had
been committed against a Levite, whose brethren were to be
found wherever the Israelites were settled, and who had on
his side the priesthood of the central sanctuary at Shiloh. He
was, too, a Levite of Mount Ephraim, and the sympathy of
the powerful tribe of Ephraim was accordingly assured to him.
The Benjamites, however, refused to hand over their fellow-tribesman
to justice, and the result was an inter-fraternal war.
Before the tribes had conquered half the country which had
been promised them, they were already fighting among themselves.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Benjamites at first were successful, and their opponents
were defeated with considerable slaughter in two successive
battles. Then they fell into an ambuscade: the main body
of their troops being drawn away after the retreating enemy
towards the north, while an ambush rose up from ‘the
meadows of Gibeah’ in their rear, and set fire to the city.
The retreating foe now turned back; and the Benjamites,
enclosed as it were between two fires, were cut to pieces
almost to a man. Six hundred only escaped ‘towards the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon,’ where they maintained
themselves for four months. Meanwhile ‘the men of Israel’
treated their Benjamite brethren like Canaanitish outcasts,
smiting ‘them with the edge of the sword, from the men of
each city even unto the beasts and all that was found; and
all the cities they came to did they set on fire.’</p>

<p class='c003'>Benjamin was almost exterminated. A few men alone
survived. But at the outset of the war they had been placed
under the same ban as the Canaanites, and a solemn vow had
been made that no Israelitish woman should be married to
them. When peace was restored with the practical annihilation
of the guilty tribe, the prohibition was evaded by a
stratagem, which, however inconsequent it may appear to the
European of to-day, was fully in keeping with the ideas of the
ancient East. Jabesh-Gilead had refused to take part in the
war against Benjamin, and the victors accordingly resolved to
take summary vengeance upon it. The city was taken by
surprise, and every male in it massacred in cold blood, as well
as ‘every woman that had lain by man.’ About four hundred
unmarried maidens were carried off to Shiloh, and there
forcibly married to the surviving Benjamites. But even these
did not suffice, and the Benjamite youths were consequently
encouraged to hide in the vineyards near Shiloh, and there
capture and make wives of the maidens of the place who
came out to dance at the yearly ‘feast of the Lord.’ The
place, we are told, was northward of Beth-el, ‘on the east side
of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and
on the south of Lebonah.’</p>

<p class='c003'>Recent critics have seen in this story merely a popular
legend intended to account for the fact that marriage by
capture was practised among the Benjamites. We might just
as well assert that the story of Gunpowder Plot is a legend
which has grown out of the customs of the 5th of November.
The critics have not even the justification that marriage by
capture was common among the Israelites. In fact, this
is the only instance of it which we meet with in the Old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Testament history of Israel—an instance so exceptional as to
be inexplicable unless it had originated under special circumstances.
It was certainly not the survival of an earlier custom
common to the rest of the tribes, nor is there any trace of its
having been general in the tribe of Benjamin itself. In fact,
we look in vain for any other example of it alike among
Israelites and Canaanites, or even among the Benjamites in
any other period of their history.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is true, however, that the account of the war between
Benjamin and its brother tribes has passed through the
magnifying lenses of later history. The exaggerated numbers
of the combatants and the slain, like the use of the universal
‘all’ and ‘every’ where the partial ‘some’ is intended, are
in thorough accordance with Oriental habits of expression.
The modern resident in the East is only too familiar with
such exaggerations of language, and in studying Oriental
history due allowance must always be made for them. In
the account of the war, moreover, its real character has been
somewhat obscured. Benjamin has been regarded too much
as a separate entity, distinct and cut off from the rest of Israel,
rather than as the tribe which had once gathered round the
sanctuary of Beth-On, and which continued to form the
‘southern’ frontier of the house of Joseph. The war against
Benjamin, in fact, was like the war against Jabesh-Gilead—a
quarrel not with a tribe, but with certain Israelitish cities. It
is even possible that in this quarrel Jabesh-Gilead was from
the beginning associated with Gibeah and the other cities of
Benjamin. At all events, we find it so allied in the age of
Saul. Saul’s first act as king was to rescue Jabesh-Gilead from
the Ammonites, and it was the men of Jabesh-Gilead who
took down the bodies of Saul and Jonathan from the walls of
Beth-Shan and gave them honourable burial.<a id='r282'></a><a href='#f282' class='c013'><sup>[282]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>The second incident, which tells us something of the
manners of Israel in the years that immediately followed
the invasion of Palestine, is recorded in language which has
been little, if at all, altered by the compiler of the Book of
Judges. The gruesome horror of the story of the Levite’s
concubine is absent from it, but it equally shows how far
from the truth is the idyllic picture sometimes painted of the
first Israelitish conquerors of Canaan. It is again a Levite
who is the central personage of the story. An Ephraimite
named Micah, we are told, stole eleven hundred shekels
of silver from his mother, but, terrified by her imprecations
upon the thief, confessed the deed and restored the money.
His mother thereupon informed him that the treasure had
been dedicated to Yahveh by her on his behalf, in order that
a graven and a molten image might be made out of it for him.
Two hundred of the shekels were accordingly taken, and the
silver employed to make the images. These were set up in
the house of Micah, along with ‘an ephod and teraphim,’ and
one of his sons was consecrated as priest. This, however,
was recognised as contrary to the law, and when therefore a
wandering Levite from Beth-lehem, ‘of the family of Judah,’
came seeking employment, he was welcomed by Micah, who
asked him if he would be his priest. His wages for undertaking
the office were to be ten shekels of silver each year, as
well as ‘a suit of apparel’ and food. The terms were accepted,
and ‘Micah consecrated’ him his priest. The provisions of
the Mosaic law had been satisfied, and the Ephraimite complacently
remarked, ‘Now know I that the Lord will do me
good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.’</p>

<p class='c003'>His complacency, however, was of no long duration. The
Danites, unable to establish themselves in the south of Canaan,
sent out five spies from their camp near Kirjath-jearim<a id='r283'></a><a href='#f283' class='c013'><sup>[283]</sup></a> who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>on their way northward were hospitably received in Micah’s
house. Here they found the Levite, with whom, it would
appear, they had been previously acquainted, and asked him
to inquire ‘of God’ whether their journey would be prosperous
or not. The priest’s reply was favourable: ‘before Yahveh is
your way wherein you go.’</p>

<p class='c003'>Far away, to the north of the other Hebrew settlements, the
spies found the Phœnician city of Laish, already mentioned in
the geographical lists of the Egyptian conqueror Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>
Its inhabitants were living in peaceful security, ‘after the
manner of the Zidonians,’ with no one to interfere with them,
and no enemy of whom they could be afraid. The spies saw
at once that the city was unprepared for a sudden attack by
armed men; that, in short, ‘God had given it into’ their hands.
They returned therefore to Mahaneh-Dan, the Camp of Dan, and
reported what they had seen. Thereupon the Danites determined
to seize an inheritance for themselves in the north, and
six hundred men ‘girded with weapons of war,’ along with their
families and cattle, started for Laish.<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c013'><sup>[284]</sup></a> On the road the spies
led them to the house of Micah, whom they robbed of his
images, ephod and teraphim, as well as of his priest. The latter
at first protested; but on being told that he would be the
priest of ‘a tribe,’ his ‘heart was glad,’ and ‘he took the ephod
and the teraphim and the graven image and went into the
midst of the people.’ Micah and his friends on discovering
the robbery pursued after the Danites, but finding they were
too strong for him he judged it prudent to return home.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Danites continued their march, and had little difficulty
in capturing the unguarded Laish, in massacring its inhabitants,
and burning the houses with fire. On the ruins they built a
new city, the Dan of future Israelitish history. Here the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>graven image of Micah was erected, and worship carried on
‘all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.’ The
Levite who presided over the sanctuary became the ancestor
of a long line of priests who continued to be ‘priests to the
tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.’<a id='r285'></a><a href='#f285' class='c013'><sup>[285]</sup></a> The
compiler of the Book of Judges adds that his name was
Jonathan, the grandson of Moses, whose name has been
changed to Manasseh in the majority of Hebrew manuscripts.<a id='r286'></a><a href='#f286' class='c013'><sup>[286]</sup></a>
The statement fixes the date of the conquest of Laish, and
shows that, like the war against Benjamin, it took place only
two generations after the great legislator’s death.</p>

<p class='c003'>The picture presented to us by the narrative stands in sharp
contrast to the ideal aimed at in the legislation of the Pentateuch.
The golden calf has been revived in an intensified
form, and the ordinary Israelite, including a Levite who was
the grandson of Moses, takes it for granted that Yahveh must
be adored in the shape of a twofold idol. Nay, more; by the
side of the graven and molten images which were meant to
represent the God of Israel in defiance of the second commandment,
we find also the images of the household gods or
teraphim, whose cult forms part of that which was paid to
the national deity. The cult, in fact, survived to the latest
days of the northern kingdom; it was practised in the household
of David (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='nineteen'>xix.</abbr> 13), and is even regarded by a
prophet of Samaria as an integral portion of the established
religion of the state (<abbr title='Hosea'>Hos.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 4). The priestly powers of the
Levite, however, suffered in no way from the idolatrous nature
of the worship over which he presided. Like David in a later
age (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-three'>xxiii.</abbr> 2, 4, 9, <abbr title='thirty'>xxx.</abbr> 8; 2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v.</abbr> 19, 23) when the
men of Dan inquired through him whether their journey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>would be successful, he was able to answer them in the name
of the Lord.</p>

<p class='c003'>But this is not all. Micah, the Ephraimite, consecrates his
own son as priest, while the Levite wanders through the land,
seeking employment and begging his bread. There is no
endowment that is his by right; no Levitical city where he can
claim a shelter and a field; no central sanctuary where his
services are required. He is said to be ‘of the family of
Judah,’ not a descendant of Levi, though the compiler implies
that the expression must not be understood in a literal sense.
And the priesthood which he established at Dan continued to
be a rival of that of ‘the sons of Aaron’ through nearly five
centuries of Israelitish national life.</p>

<p class='c003'>Criticism has drawn the conclusion that the Pentateuchal
legislation could not have been in existence at the time when
the city of Laish was taken by the tribe of Dan. The conclusion,
however, by no means follows. It is quite certain
that it was not drawn by the compiler of the Book of Judges,
who has preserved the narrative for us; and, after all, he is
more likely to have understood the ideas and feelings of the
Israelites of an earlier generation than is a European critic of
the nineteenth century. In fact, he has given us an explanation
of the contradiction between the Mosaic law and early
Israelitish practice, which not only satisfies all the conditions
of the problem, but is on the whole more probable than the
rough-and-ready solution of modern criticism. Israel in
Canaan in the first throes of the invasion was a very different
Israel from that which had lived in the desert under the immediate
control and superintendence of the legislator. It was disorganised,
it was lawless, it was broken up into fragments
which were surrounded on all sides by an alien population
whose superior culture and wealth, when it could not be seized
or destroyed, necessarily exercised a profound influence over
the ruder tribes of marauders from the desert. The Israelites
inevitably fell under the spell; they intermarried with the
natives, and adopted their gods and religious ideas.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>The proof that this is the true explanation of the disregard
or forgetfulness of the Mosaic law which characterised the
age of the Judges is furnished by the fact that this disregard or
forgetfulness was not universal. Throughout the age of the
Judges Israel possessed a central sanctuary, little though it
seems to have been frequented, and in this central sanctuary
the worship of Yahveh was conducted by ‘the sons of Aaron,’
who kept alive the memory of the legislation in the wilderness.
At Shiloh there was no image, whether graven or molten, no
figures of the teraphim, no idolatrous rites. Instead of an
image there was the ark of the covenant, with nothing within
it except the tables of the law.<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c013'><sup>[287]</sup></a> Shiloh was the only place in
Israel where the Pentateuchal enactments could be observed,
and it is only at Shiloh that we find them to have been so.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the influence of Shiloh did not extend far. It did not
even become the central sanctuary of Ephraim. The history
of Micah is alone sufficient to prove this. Ephraimite as he
was, Shiloh and its priesthood had no existence for him; his
gods and his priests were part of his own household. Equally
conclusive is the history of Gideon.</p>

<p class='c003'>The ephod after which Israel went ‘a whoring,’ was not
dedicated at Shiloh but at Ophrah, a few miles to the north;
and Baal-berith in the Ephraimitish city of Shechem had more
worshippers than Yahveh of Shiloh. Just as the spirit of
Judaism was kept alive in the age of the Maccabees among a
small remnant of the people, amid the obscurity of a country
town, so in the time of the Judges the spirit of the law was
preserved among the mountains of Ephraim in the midst of an
insignificant body of priests.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was not only with the Canaanites and with its own internal
disorganisation and dissensions that the infant nation of Israel
was called upon to contend. Foreign invasion followed
quickly on the settlement in Palestine. We have learnt from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>the tablets of Tel el-Amarna that already before the days of
the Exodus the kings of Mesopotamia had cast longing eyes
upon Canaan. To the Semites of the west Mesopotamia was
known as Naharaim, or Aram Naharaim, ‘Aram of the Two
Rivers,’ the Euphrates and Tigris, and the name was borrowed
by the Egyptians under its Aramaic form of Naharain or
Nahrina.<a id='r288'></a><a href='#f288' class='c013'><sup>[288]</sup></a> The leading state of Mesopotamia had for some
centuries been Mitanni, on the eastern bank of the Euphrates,
not far from Carchemish, and the rulers of Mitanni had made
themselves masters not only of the district between the
Euphrates and the Tigris, but also of the country westward
to the Orontes. In the age of the eighteenth Egyptian dynasty
Mitanni was the most powerful of the Asiatic kingdoms, and
the Pharaohs themselves did not disdain to unite their solar
blood with that of its royal family.</p>

<p class='c003'>From time to time, the Tel el-Amarna correspondence
teaches us, the princes of Mitanni had interfered in the affairs
of Palestine. Rib-Hadad, the governor of Phœnicia, declares
that ‘from of old’ the kings of Mitanni had been hostile to
the ancestors of the Pharaoh, and his letters are filled with
complaints that the Amorites to the north of Palestine had
revolted against Egypt with the help of Mitanni and Babylonia.
Ebed-Tob of Jerusalem, who uses the name Nahrina or
Naharain like the writers of the Old Testament, refers to the
struggles that had taken place on the waters of the Mediterranean
when Nahrina and Babylonia held possession of
Canaan. ‘When the ships,’ he says, ‘were on the sea, the
arm of the Mighty King (the god of Jerusalem) overcame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>Nahrima and Babylonia; yet now the Khabiri have overcome
the cities of the king’ (of Egypt in Southern Palestine).<a id='r289'></a><a href='#f289' class='c013'><sup>[289]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>It was not the last time that Mitanni and Egypt were ranged
on opposite sides. Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> claims to have defeated the
forces of Mitanni, and the name of the same country appears
among the conquests of Ramses <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> of the twentieth dynasty.<a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c013'><sup>[290]</sup></a>
It is coupled with Carchemish the Hittite capital among the
kingdoms over which the last of the conquering Pharaohs had
gained a victory. In the great struggle which Egypt had to
face against the Philistines and other piratic hordes from the
Greek seas, the northern invaders had carried with them in
their train contingents from the various peoples of Northern
Syria through whose lands they had passed. The Hittites
and Amorites, the inhabitants of Carchemish and Arvad, even
the people of Elishah or Cyprus, joined the invaders of Egypt,
and among the captured leaders of the enemy recorded on
the walls of Medinet Habu are the kings of the Hittites and
Amorites. The king of Mitanni, however, is wanting; enemy
though he was of the Pharaoh, he never ventured into Egypt,
and his name therefore does not appear among the conquered
chiefs. All that the Pharaoh could do was to include the
name of his kingdom among those whose forces he had
overthrown.<a id='r291'></a><a href='#f291' class='c013'><sup>[291]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The reign of Ramses <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> brings us to the moment when the
Israelites under Joshua were about to enter Canaan. Egypt
had annihilated the enemies who had invaded it, and had
carried a war of vengeance into Palestine and Syria. The
Israelite had not as yet crossed the Jordan. Among the
places in Southern Palestine subdued by Ramses are Beth-Anoth
(<abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 59), Carmel of Judah, Hebron, Ir-Shemesh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Hadashah (<abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr> 37), Shalam or Jerusalem, the districts of
the Dead Sea and the Jordan, even Korkha in the land of
Moab.<a id='r292'></a><a href='#f292' class='c013'><sup>[292]</sup></a> There is as yet no trace of Israel, and Hebron had
not as yet become the spoil of the Kenizzite.</p>

<p class='c003'>The chronology, however, makes it certain that though the
Israelites had not entered Palestine at the time of the Egyptian
campaign in that country, it could not have been very long
before they actually did so. The campaign of Ramses <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>,
in fact, prepared the way for the Israelitish invasion by weakening
the forces of the Canaanites. In any case, the victory
over the northern nations and their allies, commemorated in
the temple of Medinet Habu, must have taken place only a
few years before the Israelitish conquest of southern Canaan.<a id='r293'></a><a href='#f293' class='c013'><sup>[293]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The king of Mitanni was numbered among the enemies of
Egypt; nevertheless he had not joined the invading hordes
in their attack upon the valley of the Nile. Can it have been
that he lingered in what had once been an Egyptian province,
that land of Canaan which his forefathers had coveted before
him? The Egyptian Empire had fallen, the very existence of
Egypt itself was at stake, and the favourable opportunity had
come at last when Naharaim might make herself the mistress of
Western Asia. Babylonia was powerless like Egypt, Assyria
had not yet put forth its strength, and the Hittites barred the
old road which had led from Chaldæa to the West.</p>

<p class='c003'>The armies of Chushan-rishathaim<a id='r294'></a><a href='#f294' class='c013'><sup>[294]</sup></a> of Naharaim, accordingly,
made their way through Syria to the southern frontiers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>Palestine. They were no longer associated with those of
Babylonia, as in the days of Ebed-Tob; for a short while
Naharaim ruled supreme on the eastern coasts of the
Mediterranean. For eight years both the Canaanites and their
Israelite and Kenizzite invaders were forced to submit to its
sway. The work of conquest was checked by the stronger
hand of the foreign power.</p>

<p class='c003'>How soon after the Israelitish settlement in Canaan the
invasion of Chushan-rishathaim must have been is shown by
the fact that Othniel, the Kenizzite, the brother of Caleb, and
the conqueror of Kirjath-Sepher, was the hero who ‘delivered’
Israel from the foreign yoke. How the deliverance was
effected we do not know, whether through the death of the
king of Naharaim, or through a revolt of the Canaanites and
Syrians, or whether it was only the Israelitish tribes and not
the Canaanitish cities to which it came. What is certain is
that both the ‘oppression’ and the deliverance followed closely
on the occupation of Palestine by the Israelites. Caleb
belonged to the same generation as Moses and Joshua, and
though Othniel was his ‘younger brother,’ he too must be
counted in it. Joshua can hardly have been dead before
Israel had passed under the yoke of Naharaim.</p>

<p class='c003'>The supremacy of Naharaim extended to the southernmost
borders of Palestine. It was not an Ephraimite who
‘delivered’ Israel, but the Edomite chief at Hebron, where
the tribe of Judah had not yet established itself. The fact is
noteworthy: the first of the ‘Judges’ was a Kenizzite of
Edomite origin, and the yoke which he shook off was one
which pressed equally upon Israelites and Canaanites. In the
very act of conquering and exterminating the Canaanites,
Israel was forced to sympathise and join with them against a
common foe.</p>

<p class='c003'>The sign which gave Othniel the right to be a <span lang="hbo"><i>Shophêt</i></span> or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>‘Judge’ was twofold. ‘The spirit of Yahveh came upon him,’
and he delivered Israel from its oppressor. The Shophêt was
thus marked out by Yahveh for his office, and his success in
war was a visible token that he had been called to be the
leader of his people. The office was a peculiarly Canaanitish
institution. When Kingship was abolished at Tyre in the
time of Nebuchadrezzar, the kings were replaced by ‘Judges,’
and at Carthage the ‘Sufetes’ or ‘Judges’ were the chief
magistrates of the state.<a id='r295'></a><a href='#f295' class='c013'><sup>[295]</sup></a> Whether the institution existed
elsewhere in the Semitic world we do not know. But it was
as it were indigenous to the soil of Canaan, and in submitting
themselves to the rule of the Judges, the Israelites submitted
themselves at the same time to Canaanitish influence. It was
a step backward, a step towards absorption into the population
around them, and it is therefore not without reason that the
period of the Judges is a synonym for the period when the
religion and manners of Canaan were dominant among the
Israelitish tribes. The Pentateuch recognised the priest,
the lawgiver, and the king; the judge was the creation of an
age in which the Baalim seemed to have gained the mastery
over Yahveh.</p>

<p class='c003'>That the first of the Judges should have been of Edomite
descent is a striking commentary on what may be termed the
catholicity of pre-exilic Israel. It was not race so much as
participation in the worship and favour of Yahveh, that gave
a right to be included among ‘the chosen people.’ The
ancestress of David was a Moabitess, and the Deuteronomic
law lays down that the children of an Edomite, or even of an
Egyptian, ‘shall enter into the congregation of the Lord in
their third generation’ (<abbr title='Deuteronomy'>Deut.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-three'>xxiii.</abbr> 7, 8).<a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c013'><sup>[296]</sup></a> A ‘mixed multitude’
accompanied the Israelites in their flight from Egypt,
and the Kenites, with whom Moses was allied, shared like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Kenizzites in the conquest of Canaan. Hebron, the future
capital of Judah, and a Levitical city, was a Kenizzite possession,
and the Judah of later days was itself a mixture of
Israelitish and Edomite elements.</p>

<p class='c003'>How far the authority of Othniel extended it is difficult to
say. But the fact that the enemy, whose yoke he had broken,
was an invader from the north makes it probable that his rule
was acknowledged in Mount Ephraim as well as among the
northern tribes. That it was also acknowledged on the east
side of the Jordan there is no proof. Though the Song of
Deborah shows that the solidarity of Israel was recognised, it
also shows that this feeling of a common God and of a common
history had but little political effect. The eastern tribes lived
apart from those of the west, and the judges whom we hear
of as rising among them had purely local powers. Indeed,
between Jephthah and the Ephraimites there was internecine
war.</p>

<p class='c003'>The rule of Othniel could not have lasted long. If he
belonged to the generation which had witnessed the Exodus
out of Egypt, he would have been already an old man at the
time of the war with Chushan-rishathaim. Hardly was he
dead before Israel was again under the yoke of an oppressor.
Moab had recovered from its reverses at the hands of the
Amorites and Israelites, the Reubenites had degenerated into
mere Bedâwin squatters in the wadis of the Arnon,<a id='r297'></a><a href='#f297' class='c013'><sup>[297]</sup></a> and Eglon,
the Moabite king, now prepared to possess himself of southern
Canaan. Jericho was seized, or rather ‘the city of palm-trees’
which had succeeded to the Canaanitish Jericho, and the ford
over the Jordan was therefore secure. Eglon was followed by
bands of Amalekite Bedâwin, eager for spoil, like the Sutê who
in the age of the Tel el-Amarna correspondence were hired by
the rival princes of Canaan in their quarrels with one another.
He was also allied with the Ammonites, from which we may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>infer that the Israelites north of the Arnon, between Moab
and Ammon, had been either expelled or brought into
subjection.</p>

<p class='c003'>The capture of Jericho opened the road to Mount Ephraim
to Eglon as it had done a few years previously to Joshua.
But the Israelites were treated more mercifully than Joshua
had treated the Canaanites. Perhaps they lived in unwalled
villages rather than in fortified towns, and their culture was
not high enough to tempt an enemy with the prospect of a
rich booty. At all events we hear of no massacres or burnt
cities; the Israelites are laid under tribute, that is all.</p>

<p class='c003'>For eighteen years they served Eglon. Then Ehud, the
Benjamite, who like so many of his tribe was left-handed,<a id='r298'></a><a href='#f298' class='c013'><sup>[298]</sup></a> was
chosen to carry the yearly tribute to the conqueror. Eglon
was encamped at Gilgal, in the very spot where the Israelitish
camp had so long stood, and received the envoys in the upper
story of his house, immediately under the roof. When the
tribute-bearers had been dismissed, Ehud, who had gone as far
as the sacred ‘circle’ of hallowed stones,<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c013'><sup>[299]</sup></a> turned back with
the excuse that he had a secret message for the king, which
demanded the utmost privacy. Taking advantage of his
solitude, Ehud seized his sword with his left hand and plunged
it into the body of Eglon, then, locking the door of the room
behind him, he escaped through the columned verandah.
Before the murder was discovered he had made his way to
Seirath, and gathered around him the Israelites of Mount
Ephraim. The fords across the Jordan were occupied, and the
flying Moabites slain at them to a man.</p>

<p class='c003'>It would seem that the Moabite ‘oppression’ did not extend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>beyond Mount Ephraim. Ephraim and Benjamin were the
tribes who had suffered from it, and it was over them accordingly
that Ehud was judge. His authority does not appear to
have been recognised further to the north or to the south.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the south, indeed, there were other enemies to be contended
against, and there was another hero who had risen up
against them. The Edomite and Jewish settlers found themselves
confronted by those formidable sea-robbers who had
once dared the whole power of Egypt, and were now
established on the southern coast of Palestine. The Philistines,
called Pulista by the Egyptians, Palastâ and Pilistâ by the
Assyrians, were new-comers like the Israelites. They had
come from Caphtor, which modern research tends to identify
with the island of Krete, and, along with their kinsfolk the
Zakkal, had taken part in the invasion of Egypt by the
barbarians of the north at the beginning of the reign of
Ramses <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr><a id='r300'></a><a href='#f300' class='c013'><sup>[300]</sup></a> It is the first time that their name is mentioned
in the Egyptian annals. But the Zakkal, who afterwards
settled on the Canaanitish coast to the north of them, and
whom they resembled in dress and features, are mentioned
among the invaders against whom Meneptah <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> had to contend,
and it is therefore possible that the Philistines also were
included in the host whose assault upon Egypt seems to have
been connected with the Hebrew Exodus. At any rate, at the
very moment when the Israelites were making ready to enter
Canaan, the Philistines had already possessed themselves of
the five cities which guarded its southern frontier. The date
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>of the conquest can be fixed within a few years. Ramses <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>
tells us that the barbarians had swept through Syria, where
they had established their camp in the ‘land of the Amorites’
northward of Canaan. Then they fell upon Egypt partly by
land, partly by sea. This may be the time when the five cities
of Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron, and Gath were captured by
the Philistines; if so, Gaza must have again become Egyptian
after the overthrow of the invading hordes, since Ramses <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>
includes it among the conquests of his campaign in southern
Palestine. But it could not have remained long in his hands.
The key of Syria, the frontier town which had so long been
garrisoned by Egyptian troops, at last ceased to be Egyptian,
and became Philistine. Henceforth Egypt was cut off from
Asia; ‘the way of the Philistines’ was guarded by the
Philistines themselves.<a id='r301'></a><a href='#f301' class='c013'><sup>[301]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The actual occupation of ‘Philistia’ was doubtless preceded
by piratical descents upon the coast. This, in fact, seems to
be indicated by the statement in the book of Exodus that the
Israelitish fugitives were not led by ‘the way of the Philistines’
lest they should ‘see war.’ From the time when the northern
barbarians first attacked Egypt in the reign of Meneptah <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>
down to the final settlement of the Philistines on the Syrian
coast after the Asiatic campaign of Ramses <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>, the conquest
of the Canaanitish coast was slowly going on. All the while
that the Israelites were in the desert, the Philistines of Caphtor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>were creating their new kingdom for themselves. They were
one of the ‘hornets’ which Yahveh had sent before Israel into
the Promised Land. When Judah and Simeon eventually took
possession of southern Canaan, they found the Philistines too
firmly established to be dislodged.<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c013'><sup>[302]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>It was not only from their walled cities in Palestine that the
Philistines derived their strength. They were within easy
reach of their kinsmen in Krete, and fresh supplies of
emigrants were doubtless brought to them from time to time
in Kretan ships. Greek tradition knew of a time when Minôs,
the Kretan king, held command of the sea, and it is said that
the sea between Gaza and Egypt was called ‘the Ionian.’<a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c013'><sup>[303]</sup></a> In
the reign of Hezekiah we learn from the Assyrian king Sargon
that when the people of Ashdod deposed their prince the
usurper whom they placed on the throne was still a ‘Greek’
(<i>Yavani</i>).</p>

<p class='c003'>The features of the Philistine are known to us from the
Egyptian sculptures. They offer a marked contrast to those
of his Semitic neighbours. They are, in fact, the features of
the typical Greek, with straight nose, high forehead, and thin
lips. Like the Zakkal he wears on his head a curious sort of
pleated cap, which is fastened round the chin by a strap.
Besides the cap, and sometimes a cuirass of leather, his dress
consisted of a kilt, or perhaps a pair of drawers, similar to
those depicted on objects of the ‘Mykenæan’ period, and he
was armed with a small round shield with two handles, a spear,
and a short but broad sword of bronze. The kilt and arms
were the same as those of the Shardana or Sardinians.<a id='r304'></a><a href='#f304' class='c013'><sup>[304]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The Philistines were thus aliens on the soil of Canaan.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Their Hebrew neighbours stigmatised them as the ‘uncircumcised,’
and in the Septuagint they are called the Allophyli or
‘Foreigners.’ But they mixed in time with the Avim whom
they had displaced.<a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c013'><sup>[305]</sup></a> The Amoritish Anakim survived at
Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod (<abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='eleven'>xi.</abbr> 22), and Goliath of Gath
was reputed one of their descendants. The Philistines
borrowed, moreover, numerous words from the Semitic
vocabulary, if indeed they did not adopt ‘the language of
Canaan’ altogether. Their five ‘lords’ took the Semitic title
of <i>seren</i>, and the supreme god of Gaza was called by the
Semitic name of Marna or ‘Lord.’ Dagon, whose temple
stood at Gaza, was a Babylonian god whose name and worship
had been brought to the West in early days.<a id='r306'></a><a href='#f306' class='c013'><sup>[306]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The Israelites soon found that the Philistines were dangerous
neighbours. From their five strongholds in the south they
issued forth to plunder and destroy. Judah and Simeon were
the first to suffer, while such parts of the heritage assigned to
Dan as had not been annexed to Ephraim or Benjamin passed
into Philistine hands.<a id='r307'></a><a href='#f307' class='c013'><sup>[307]</sup></a> But the central and northern tribes
did not escape. We learn from an unpublished Egyptian
papyrus in the possession of <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Golénischeff that Dor, a little
to the south of Mount Carmel, had been occupied by the
Zakkal, the kinsmen of the Philistines, so that the whole coast
from Gaza to Carmel may be said to have become Philistine.
From hence their raiding parties penetrated into the interior,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>and depopulated the villages of Ephraim and Manasseh, of
Zebulon and of Naphtali.</p>

<p class='c003'>Such at least is the conclusion to be drawn from a
comparison of the Song of Deborah with the statement that
the Shamgar ben Anath, Shamgar the son of Anath, ‘delivered
Israel,’ by slaying six hundred Philistines with an ox-goad.
Shamgar, as we gather from the Song, lived but a short while
before Deborah herself, and it was in his days, we further read,
that the Israelitish peasantry were almost exterminated by their
enemies. The Philistine invasion in the time of Samuel was
but a repetition of earlier raids.</p>

<p class='c003'>The name of Shamgar testifies to the survival of Babylonian
influence in Canaan. It is the Babylonian Sumgir, while
Anath is the Babylonian goddess Anat, the consort of Anu,
the god of the sky. In one of the Tel el-Amarna tablets two
Syrians are referred to, who bear the names of Ben-Ana and
Anat.<a id='r308'></a><a href='#f308' class='c013'><sup>[308]</sup></a> Does this survival of Babylonian names imply a
survival also of the Babylonian script and language? At all
events the worship of Babylonian deities still survived, and an
Israelite and a ‘judge’ was named after one of them.</p>

<p class='c003'>Deborah couples with Shamgar the otherwise unknown
Jael. The reading is possibly corrupt, another name having
been assimilated to that of the wife of the Kenite. But it is
also possible that it is due to a marginal gloss which has crept
into the text.</p>

<p class='c003'>However this may be, the age of Shamgar overlapped that
of the prophetess Deborah. ‘In the days of Shamgar,’ she
says, ‘the highways were unoccupied ... until that I, Deborah,
arose—that I arose a mother in Israel.’ It was not only from
the incursions of the Philistines that the Israelites suffered.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>In the north the tribes were called upon to face a confederacy
of the Canaanitish states. It was the last effort of Canaan to
stem the gradual advance of Israel, and the struggle was
decided in the plain of Megiddo, as it had been in the older
days of Egyptian invasion and conquest.</p>

<p class='c003'>Megiddo and Taanach were still Canaanitish fortresses; so,
too, was Beth-shean, in the valley of the Jordan,<a id='r309'></a><a href='#f309' class='c013'><sup>[309]</sup></a> and the
Israelites of Mount Ephraim were thus cut off from their
brethren in the north. Here Jabin, the king of Hazor, was
the dominant Canaanite prince, whose standard was followed
by the other ‘kings of Canaan.’ Twenty years long, we are
told, ‘he mightily oppressed the children of Israel,’ ‘for he had
nine hundred chariots of iron.’<a id='r310'></a><a href='#f310' class='c013'><sup>[310]</sup></a> Two accounts of the ‘oppression’
and the war that put an end to it have been handed
down, one a prose version, which the compiler of the book of
Judges has made part of his narrative, while the other is contained
in the song of victory composed by Deborah after the
overthrow of the foe.</p>

<p class='c003'>Critics have found discrepancies between the two accounts,
and have maintained that where they differ the prose version
is unhistorical. In the latter the Canaanitish leader is the
king of Hazor, Sisera being his general, who ‘dwelt in Harosheth
of the Gentiles,’ whereas in the song there is no mention
of Hazor, and Sisera appears as a Canaanitish king. Moreover,
it is alleged that, according to the Song (<abbr title='verse'>v.</abbr> 12), Barak
seems to have belonged to the tribe of Issachar, while in the
prose narrative he is said to have come from Kadesh of
Naphtali, and it is further asserted that Hazor had already
been taken and destroyed in the time of Joshua.</p>

<p class='c003'>The author of the book of Judges, however, failed to see
the discrepancies which have been discovered by the modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>European critic, and he has accordingly set the prose narrative
by the side of the Song without note or comment. As
the king of Hazor did not personally take part in the battle on
the banks of the Kishon, there was no occasion for any reference
to him in the Song, and that the commander of his army
should have been one of his royal allies is surely nothing
extraordinary. In the Song, Barak is expressly distinguished
from ‘the princes of Issachar,’<a id='r311'></a><a href='#f311' class='c013'><sup>[311]</sup></a> and the question of the
destruction of Hazor by Joshua has already been dealt with.
It is a gratuitous supposition that the introduction of Jabin into
the narrative, and the reference to Harosheth, are the inventions
of popular legend or interested historians.</p>

<p class='c003'>The prophetess Deborah, the wife of Lapidoth, ‘judged
Israel’ at the time of the war. Her name means ‘Bee,’ and
a connection has been sought between it and the fact that the
priestesses of Apollo at Delphi, of Dêmêter, of Artemis, and
of Kybelê, were called ‘bees,’ while the high priest of Artemis
at Ephesus bore the title of the ‘king-bee.’<a id='r312'></a><a href='#f312' class='c013'><sup>[312]</sup></a> We might as
well look for a connection between the name of her husband
and the ‘lamps’ of the sanctuary. Deborah ‘judged Israel’
because she was a prophetess, because she was the interpretress
of the will of Yahveh, whose spirit breathed within her. The
‘judgments’ she delivered were accordingly the judgments of
Yahveh Himself, and the indwelling of His spirit was the sign
of her claim to the office of ‘judge.’ We hear of other prophetesses
in Israel besides Deborah; Huldah, for example,
who was consulted by the king and the priests in the reign of
Josiah. The position held by the prophetess prevented the
Israelitish women from sinking into the abject condition of
the women among some of the Arab and other Semitic tribes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>In fact, women have played a leading part in Hebrew history.
It has long ago been noticed that the mother had much to do
with the character of the successive kings of Judah, and
Athaliah of Samaria filled a prominent place in the history of
the northern kingdom. Prophecy was no respecter of persons;
it came to rich and poor, to learned and simple, to men
and women alike, and upon whomsoever the spirit of prophecy
fell, it made him fit to be the leader and the counsellor of his
people. Deborah had been marked out by Yahveh Himself
to be the judge of Israel.</p>

<p class='c003'>She dwelt, we are told, under the palm-tree of Deborah,
between Ramah and Beth-el in Mount Ephraim. She was,
therefore, presumably of Ephraimitish descent, though the
conclusion does not necessarily follow, and the palm-tree
which was called after her continued to be a landmark on the
high-road down to the time when the narrative in the book of
Judges was written. There was another tree, a terebinth, and
not a palm, which stood within the sacred precincts of Beth-el
itself, and also bore the name of Deborah, but this Deborah
was said to have been Rebekah’s nurse, whose tomb was
pointed out under the branches of the tree.<a id='r313'></a><a href='#f313' class='c013'><sup>[313]</sup></a> The writers of
the Old Testament have carefully distinguished between the
two trees; it has been reserved for modern criticism to confound
them.</p>

<p class='c003'>With a woman’s insight and enthusiasm, Deborah perceived
that the time had come when the highways should no longer
be deserted, and when the northern tribes of Israel should be
freed from their bondage to the Canaanite, and she also perceived
who it was that was destined to lead the Israelitish
troops to victory. This was Barak of Kadesh in Naphtali,
the near neighbour of Jabin and Sisera. Like the Carthaginian
Barcas, he bore a name—‘the Lightning’—which fitly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>symbolised the vengeance he was born to take on the enemies
of Israel.<a id='r314'></a><a href='#f314' class='c013'><sup>[314]</sup></a> But Barak shrank from the undertaking at first,
and it was not until the prophetess had consented to go with
him to Kadesh that he summoned his countrymen together,
and occupied the summit of Mount Tabor. Here, protected
by the forests which clothed its slopes, he trained and multiplied
his forces until he felt strong enough to attack the foe.
Then he descended into the plain of Megiddo, where the
Canaanitish host was marching from Harosheth to meet him.
It was the old battlefield of Canaan; it was there that in
the days of the Egyptian conquerors the fate of the country
had been decided and the Canaanitish princes under Hittite
commanders from Kadesh on the Orontes had been utterly
overthrown.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the camp on the lofty summit of Tabor, Barak had
done more than train his men. Time had been given them in
which to provide themselves with arms. Deborah declares
that in the days of the oppression a shield or spear had not
been seen ‘among forty thousand in Israel.’<a id='r315'></a><a href='#f315' class='c013'><sup>[315]</sup></a> The statement
receives explanation from what we are told of the policy of the
Philistines at a later date. When they had laid the Israelites
under tribute in the time of Samuel, they banished all the
smiths from the land of Israel, to prevent ‘the Hebrews’ from
making themselves ‘swords and spears’ (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='thirteen'>xiii.</abbr> 19).
Agricultural implements alone were allowed (<abbr title='verse'>ver.</abbr> 20). It would
seem that a similar policy had been pursued by the Philistines
and Canaanites in the earlier age of Deborah, though probably
with less success. At all events Heber the Kenite, or itinerant
‘smith,’ still pitched his tent in Israelitish territory, and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>wife Jael sympathised with the Israelites rather than with their
Canaanitish lords.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> of Egypt met the confederated kings
of Canaan in the plain of Megiddo, they were led by the
Hittite sovereign of Kadesh on the Orontes. It is possible
that Barak was called upon to meet a similar combination of
forces. Sisera is not a Semitic name, while, as Mr. Tomkins
has pointed out, it finds striking analogies in such Hittite
names as Khata-sar, Khilip-sar, and Pi-siri[s]. The Hittite
power at Kadesh on the Orontes had not yet passed away. It
still existed in the time of David, when it formed one of the
frontiers of the Israelitish kingdom.<a id='r316'></a><a href='#f316' class='c013'><sup>[316]</sup></a> In the age of the Tel
el-Amarna letters we find the Hittites intriguing in Palestine
along with Mitanni or Naharaim, and it is not likely that they
would have been less disposed to resume their old influence
in that country when Egypt was no longer to be feared. Sisera
may not only have been the commander of the Canaanitish
forces, but also a Hittite prince, nominally the ally of Jabin,
but in reality his suzerain lord. He dwelt, we are told, in
‘Harosheth of the Gentiles,’ an otherwise unknown place. It
may have been in ‘Galilee of the Gentiles’ (<abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='nine'>ix.</abbr> 1), but it
may also have been further north among the Gentile Hittites
of Kadesh.<a id='r317'></a><a href='#f317' class='c013'><sup>[317]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The battle took place on the banks of the Kishon, and
ended in a complete victory for the Israelites. The nine
hundred iron chariots of Sisera availed him nothing; ‘the
stars in their courses’ had fought against him. He escaped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>on foot to the tent of Heber the Kenite, whose wife Jael
received him as a guest, and then murdered him by driving a
peg of the tent through his temples while he lay asleep. When
Barak arrived in pursuit, Jael showed him the corpse of his
enemy.</p>

<p class='c003'>The pæan of triumph, ‘sung by Deborah and Barak’ on the
day of the victory, is one of the oldest fragments of Hebrew
poetry. To its antiquity and the archaic character of its
language are due the many corruptions of the text. Some of
the passages in it are quite unintelligible as they stand, and
the conjectural emendations that have been proposed for them
are seldom acceptable except to their authors.<a id='r318'></a><a href='#f318' class='c013'><sup>[318]</sup></a> But, as a
whole, the pæan is not only a magnificent relic of ancient
Hebrew song, full of fire and vivid imagery, it is also a document
of the highest value for the historian. It gives us a
picture of Israelitish life and thought in the age of the Judges,
untouched by the hands of compilers and historians, and few
have been hardy enough to question its genuineness. It is a
solid proof that the traditional view of Israelitish history is
more correct than that which modern criticism would substitute
for it, and that the ‘development’ of Israelitish religion,
of which we have heard so much, is a mere product of the
imagination. The belief in Yahveh displayed in the Song is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>as uncompromising as that of later Judaism; Yahveh is the
God of Israel, who has fought for His people, and beside Him
there is no other god. The monotheism of Deborah is the
monotheism of the Pentateuch. Nor is the song less of a
witness to the truth of the history which we have in the
Pentateuch and the book of Joshua. It tells us that Yahveh
revealed Himself to Israel on Mount Sinai, and it distinguishes
the tribes one from the other, and assigns to them the territories
which bore their names.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Song began with words which, as we see from <abbr title='Deuteronomy'>Deut.</abbr>
<abbr title='thirty-three'>xxxiii.</abbr> 2, <abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr> <abbr title='sixty-eight'>lxviii.</abbr> 7, were a common property of Hebrew
poetry.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of Barak and Deborah we hear no more. The next judge
and deliverer who appears upon the canvas is an Abi-ezrite of
Manasseh, who came from the northern borders of Ephraim between
Ophrah and Shechem. His father was Joash, the head, it
would seem, of the clan. But he himself bears a double name.
It is as Gideon, the ‘cutter-down’ of his father’s idol, that he
is first introduced to us. In later history his name is Jerubbaal.
The latter name is said to have been given him because he had
thrown down the altar of Baal, and is interpreted to mean
‘Let Baal plead against him.’<a id='r330'></a><a href='#f330' class='c013'><sup>[330]</sup></a> But the other Old Testament
examples we have met with of the interpretation of proper
names may well make us hesitate about accepting this. They
are all mere plays upon words, mere ‘popular etymologies,’ which
have no claim to be regarded as history. Whether the philology
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>is that of an ancient Hebrew writer or of a modern critic, its
conclusions do not belong to the domain of the historian.</p>

<p class='c003'>Jerubbaal signifies ‘Baal will contend,’ not ‘Baal will plead
against him,’ and therefore really has a meaning exactly the
reverse of that ascribed to it in the narrative. The name
seems substantially identical with that of Rib-Hadad, the
governor of Phœnicia in the age of the Tel el-Amarna tablets.
Joash, the father of Jerubbaal, was a worshipper of Baal, and
consequently there was nothing strange in his calling his son
after his god. It is only as Jerubbaal that the future judge was
known to the generation that followed him,<a id='r331'></a><a href='#f331' class='c013'><sup>[331]</sup></a> and his successor
in the kingdom of Manasseh was called even in his own day
‘Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal.’<a id='r332'></a><a href='#f332' class='c013'><sup>[332]</sup></a> It has been suggested
that Jerubbaal and Gideon were two different personages, whom
tradition has amalgamated together,<a id='r333'></a><a href='#f333' class='c013'><sup>[333]</sup></a> but double names of the
kind were not unknown in Oriental antiquity. Solomon himself
also bore the name of Jedidiah (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='twelve'>xii.</abbr> 25), and
Gideon, ‘the cutter-down,’ was not an inappropriate epithet
for the conqueror of the Midianites. There was a good
reason why the pious Israelite of a later generation should
shrink from admitting that one of his national heroes had
borne a name compounded with that of Baal.<a id='r334'></a><a href='#f334' class='c013'><sup>[334]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The tribes of the desert, Amalekites, Midianites, and those
Benê-Qedem or ‘Children of the East,’ whom an Egyptian
papyrus of the twelfth dynasty places in the neighbourhood of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Edom,<a id='r335'></a><a href='#f335' class='c013'><sup>[335]</sup></a> had fallen upon the lands of the settled fellahin, as
their Bedâwin descendants still do whenever the Turkish
soldiery are insufficient to keep them away. Year by year
bands of raiders swarmed over the cultivated fields, murdering
the peasants and carrying off their crops. At first it was
Gilead that suffered, but the Hebrews were weak and divided,
and the robbers of the desert were soon emboldened to cross
the Jordan, and extend their raids as far as the western
frontiers of Israel. ‘They destroyed the increase of the
earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for
Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.’</p>

<p class='c003'>At last the Lord sent a prophet to the people and an angel
to Gideon the Abi-ezrite. Gideon was threshing wheat by the
winepress near the sacred terebinth of Ophrah. Here, under
the shadow of the tree, was an altar of Baal, and by the side
of it the cone of stone which symbolised the goddess Asherah.
The angel summoned Gideon to rise and deliver Israel, and as
a sign that he was indeed the angel of Yahveh he touched
with his staff the offerings of flesh and unleavened cakes that
Gideon had made to him, so that fire rose out of the rock and
consumed them all. On the threshing-floor Gideon built an
altar to Yahveh, like that more stately sanctuary which David
raised in later days on the threshing-floor of rock which had
belonged to Araunah the Jebusite.</p>

<p class='c003'>Recent criticism has discovered in the history of Jerubbaal
two different and mutually inconsistent narratives, which are
again subdivided among a variety of writers. To these some
critics would add a third version of the story, which is
supposed to be referred to in <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'>x.</abbr> 26, though others maintain
that the reference in the book of Isaiah is to the first of the
two narratives. It cannot be denied that the history of the
war against the Midianites in its present form is confused, and
that it is difficult to construct from it a clear and intelligible
picture of the course of events. That the compiler of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>book of Judges should have made use of more than one
narrative, if such existed, is indeed only natural, and what a
conscientious historian would be bound to do. But to distinguish
minutely the narratives one from the other, much more
to analyse them into still smaller fragments, is the work of
Sisyphus. It is even more impossible than to distinguish
between Rice and Besant in <i>The Golden Butterfly</i> or <i>Celia’s
Arbour</i>. The historian must leave all such literary trifling to
the collectors of lists of words, and content himself with comparing
and analysing the facts recorded in the story.<a id='r336'></a><a href='#f336' class='c013'><sup>[336]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The altar raised by Gideon was dedicated to Yahveh-shalom,
‘the Yahveh of Peace,’ and it was still standing at Ophrah
when the narrative relating to it was written.<a id='r337'></a><a href='#f337' class='c013'><sup>[337]</sup></a> Its name shows
that it could hardly have been built before Gideon had returned
in peace from the Midianitish war. There was much
that had first to be done.</p>

<p class='c003'>Gideon’s first task was to destroy the symbol of Asherah
and the altar of Baal. The revelation made to him had been
made in the name of Yahveh, and it was in the name of
Yahveh alone that he was about to lead his countrymen to
victory. It is true that between Yahveh and Baal the Israelite
villager of the day saw but little difference. Yahveh was
addressed as Baal or ‘Lord,’<a id='r338'></a><a href='#f338' class='c013'><sup>[338]</sup></a> and the local altars that were
dedicated to Him in most instances did but take the place of the
older altars of a Canaanitish Baal. Mixture between Israelites
and Canaanites, moreover, had brought with it a mixture in
religion. Along with the title, Yahveh had assumed the
attributes of a Baal, at all events among the mass of the
people. Joash and the villagers, who demanded that Gideon
should be put to death for destroying the altar of Baal, doubtless
thought that they were zealous for the God of Israel.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>It was the symbol of Asherah only which was the token of a
foreign cult.</p>

<p class='c003'>Perhaps the answer made by Joash to the charge against his
son has been coloured by the theology of the later historian.
It breathes rather the spirit of an age when the antagonism
between Yahveh and Baal had become acute than that of one
who was himself a worshipper of Baal and Asherah, and whose
son in the hour of victory made an idol out of the enemy’s
spoil. The Baal worshipped by the villagers of Abi-ezer was
regarded as Yahveh himself, and hence it was that the offence
committed by Gideon against him was an offence committed
against the national God, and therefore punishable with death.
To set him up as another god in opposition to the God of
Israel carries us down to the age of Elijah, when the subjects
of Ahab were called upon to choose between the Yahveh who
had led them out of Egypt and the Phœnician Baal. It
belongs to the same period as the etymological play on the
name of Jerubbaal.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was a special reason why Jerubbaal should thus have
come forward to deliver his countrymen from the Midianites.
The Bedâwin raiders had slain his brothers in a previous
struggle at Mount Tabor (<abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 18-21). Jerubbaal thus had a
blood-feud to avenge. He was the last and presumably the
youngest of his family, and upon him therefore devolved the
duty of revenging his brothers’ death. Moreover, it would
appear from the words of the Midianite chiefs that Joash and
his sons were not only the heads of their clan, but that they
also exercised a sort of kingly authority in Ophrah and its
neighbourhood. The history of Abimelech seems to imply
that the family of Abi-ezer had succeeded to the power and
even the name of the Canaanitish ‘kings’ of Shechem, and
that the subsequent ingratitude of the inhabitants of Shechem
to the house of Jerubbaal was due to jealousy of the preference
displayed by it for Ophrah. Shechem contained a large
Canaanitish element which was wanting at Ophrah, where the
population was more purely Israelitish. If Joash were thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>king of a mixed population, recognised by Canaanites and
Israelites alike, we can understand why by the side of the
altar of Baal there stood also the symbol of the Canaanitish
goddess. The very fact that the sanctuary of Ophrah belonged
to him (vi. 25) indicates that he possessed royal prerogatives.
Even at Jerusalem the temple of Solomon was as it were the
chapel of the kings.<a id='r339'></a><a href='#f339' class='c013'><sup>[339]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>It has been suggested that the Baal whose altar stood on
the land of Joash at Ophrah was the Baal-berith or ‘Baal of
the Covenant,’ worshipped at Shechem,<a id='r340'></a><a href='#f340' class='c013'><sup>[340]</sup></a> and that the ‘covenant’
over which the god presided was that made between the
Canaanites of Shechem and their Hebrew master. Doubtless
the two elements in the population would have interpreted the
name in a different way. For the Hebrews the ‘Baal of the
Covenant’ would have been Yahveh; for the Canaanites he
would have been the local sun-god. But there is nothing to
prove that the attributes of the Baals of Ophrah and Shechem
were the same, or that they were adored under the same form.
Indeed, the fact that the altar erected by Jerubbaal at Ophrah
was dedicated to the ‘Yahveh of Peace’ tells rather in a contrary
direction. Shechem had its Baal-berith, while Ophrah
may have had its Baal-shalom. While the one commemorated
the covenant that had been entered into between the two parts
of the population, the other would have commemorated its
‘peaceful’ settlement. For the Canaanite it was a covenant,
for the Hebrew it was peace.</p>

<p class='c003'>The struggle at Mount Tabor, in which the brothers of
Jerubbaal had fallen, laid the fruitful valley of Jezreel at the
feet of the Bedâwin plunderers. The plain of Megiddo was
now in the hands of the Israelites. The battle on the banks
of the Kishon had broken for ever the power of the Canaanites
and their ‘chariots of iron,’ and they were now tributary to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>Manasseh.<a id='r341'></a><a href='#f341' class='c013'><sup>[341]</sup></a> The Canaanite townsman and the Israelitish
peasant were now living in peaceful intermixture, and the
torrent of raiders from the desert fell upon both alike. We
hear no more of any attempts made by the older population
to shake off the Hebrew yoke; it suffers from the Midianite
invasion equally with its Hebrew masters, and the family of
Joash govern it as much as they govern the Israelites themselves.
Jerubbaal is the deliverer of the Canaanite as well as
of the Israelite.</p>

<p class='c003'>From Ophrah he sends messengers throughout Manasseh,
as well as to the tribes of Asher, Zebulon, and Naphtali, and
their fighting-men gather together at his summons. He thus
acts like a king, and is obeyed like a king. Though he may
not have actually borne the royal title, he was more than a
mere ‘judge.’ Barak may have assumed the name and
prerogatives of the Canaanitish kings he had conquered, and
have passed them on to the family of Ebi-ezer. At any rate
the power of Joash must have extended beyond Shechem and
Ophrah; all Manasseh obeys the call of his son, and even the
more distant northern tribes come at his bidding. The subjugation
of the Canaanites had demanded a head to the state,
and their union with their conquerors implied an organised
community under a common king.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was, however, with three hundred chosen followers that
Jerubbaal made his first attack upon the foe. Encouraged by
a dream, he fell upon their camp by night, and his followers,
breaking the pitchers they carried with them, and waving
torches in their left hands, caused such a panic among the
undisciplined hordes of the desert that they fled in all directions.<a id='r342'></a><a href='#f342' class='c013'><sup>[342]</sup></a>
The rout of the enemy was completed by the rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>of the Israelitish army, which pursued the Midianites eastward
towards the Jordan. Part of them under the shêkhs Oreb
and Zeeb made for the ford at Beth-barah, where, however,
they were intercepted by the Ephraimites, and their chiefs
slain at ‘the rock of Oreb’ and the ‘winepress of Zeeb.’<a id='r343'></a><a href='#f343' class='c013'><sup>[343]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Meanwhile Jerubbaal was already on the eastern side of the
Jordan, following in hot haste a detachment of the Midianites
under two other of their shêkhs, Zebah and Zalmunna.
His road led past Succoth and Penuel, but their Israelitish
inhabitants refused all help, and even bread, to their brethren
of Manasseh. It is clear that between Gilead and the western
tribes there was now a diversity of interests and feelings, and
that the half-nomad Israelites on the eastern side of the
Jordan had more sympathy with the heathen of the desert
than with the ruler of the organised state on the other side of
the river. Perhaps they feared that his arms would next be
turned against themselves, and that they too would be forced
to become part of a kingdom of Manasseh.</p>

<p class='c003'>But if they had hoped that the Midianites would have freed
them from all fears upon this score they were doomed to
disappointment. Once more ‘the sword of Yahveh and of
Gideon’ prevailed, and Zebah and Zalmunna were slain. The
claims of the blood-feud were satisfied, and Jerubbaal now
returned to his old home. Condign vengeance was taken on
‘the elders’ of Succoth and ‘the men’ of Penuel. The first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>were scourged with the thorns of the wilderness, the others
were put to death, and their tower, which guarded the approach
from the desert, was razed to the ground.</p>

<p class='c003'>Now, however, Jerubbaal had to meet with more formidable
adversaries. The house of Joseph was divided against itself,
and the Ephraimites resented his conduct in acting independently
of the elder tribe.<a id='r344'></a><a href='#f344' class='c013'><sup>[344]</sup></a> In the earlier days of the
occupation of Palestine it had been Ephraim which took the
leading part; Joshua, who first opened the path into Canaan,
had been an Ephraimite, and Mount Ephraim had been the
first stronghold of Israel on the western side of the Jordan. In
the time of Barak Ephraim had still been the dominant tribe,
at least such is the impression we gather from the Song of
Deborah; but it had begun to live on its past glories rather
than on its present achievements. The Benjamites had
definitely separated from it, and become a separate tribe,
and Issachar, Zebulon, and Naphtali had carried on the war
against Jabin and Sisera. Manasseh, however, had not yet
appeared on the political scene; its place was taken by
Machir, whose territory lay in Gilead, not to the west of
the Jordan. But between the age of Barak and that of
Jerubbaal a change had occurred. The Canaanitish towns,
which the victory on the banks of the Kishon had laid at the
feet of the northern tribes, passed into the possession of the
younger branch of the house of Joseph, and Issachar had to
be content that Shechem also should become a part of its
territory.<a id='r345'></a><a href='#f345' class='c013'><sup>[345]</sup></a> Manasseh grew at the expense of its neighbours.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>It is possible that the clan of the Abi-ezrites at Ophrah had,
by their conquest of Shechem, paved the way for the rise of
Manasseh; if so, the dominant position they occupied in the
tribe would become intelligible. Ophrah would have been
the first home and gathering-place of the tribe. The treaty
with Shechem, which united that city with Ophrah, may have
been the beginning of Manasseh’s rise to power.</p>

<p class='c003'>But Ephraim could ill brook the growing ascendency of the
younger tribe. Manasseh had become wealthy from the
tribute levied on its Canaanitish subjects; it had united itself
with the older inhabitants of the land, and had borrowed their
habits and their culture, and therewith their idolatries as well.
The mountaineers of Ephraim, on the other hand, had retained
much of the roughness and the virtues of the first invaders of
Palestine. They were still warlike and hardy; they held the
fortress of the Israelitish possessions in Canaan; and Shiloh,
with its Aaronic priesthood, its traditions of the Mosaic law,
and its purer worship of Yahveh was in their midst. Jerubbaal
was forced to temporise with them. He pointed out that the
destruction of the main body of the Midianites at the fords of
the Jordan was a greater achievement than his own successful
pursuit of the remaining bands. He had slain Zebah and
Zalmunna in revenge for the death of his brothers; the
slaughter of Oreb and Zeeb had been for the sake of all
Israel. ‘Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better
than the vintage of Abi-ezer?’</p>

<p class='c003'>Jerubbaal was fitted to rule, for he possessed statecraft as
well as military ability. His statecraft was shown not only in
his answer to the Ephraimites, but also in his refusal to accept
the title of king. It was pressed upon him, we are told, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>‘the men of Israel’—that is to say, by the northern tribes.
Whether his father had actually borne the title we cannot
say, though it would seem from the subsequent history of
Abimelech, as well as from the words of Zebah and Zalmunna
(<abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 18), that he must have done so. But at any rate he had
exercised the authority of a king, like his son Jerubbaal, at the
outset of the Midianite war, and it may be that among the
Canaanites of Shechem he had also the name of king.
Jerubbaal, however, if we are to regard the passage as historical,
rejected the crown offered him by the Israelites,
declaring that their king was Yahveh alone.</p>

<p class='c003'>That the passage is historical seems to admit of little doubt.
Jerubbaal’s words were in harmony with the feelings of the
time among the stricter adherents of Yahveh, as we learn
from the language of Samuel when the people demanded of
him a king. How different were the feelings of the compiler
of the book of Judges may be gathered from the words with
which it ends. Moreover, Jerubbaal’s refusal of the royal
title was politic. He had already realised that he had powerful
enemies in Ephraim, who viewed his success and claims
to power with suspicion and hostility, and he also knew that
it was in Ephraim and among the priesthood of Shiloh that
the belief in the theocratic government of Israel was strongest.
As in Assyria, in Midian, and in Sheba, so too in Israel, the
high priest preceded the king; it was not until the need for a
single head and a leader in war became too urgent to be
resisted that the national God made way for a national king.<a id='r346'></a><a href='#f346' class='c013'><sup>[346]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Phœnician tradition remembered that Jerubbaal was a priest
of Yahveh, not that he was a king.<a id='r347'></a><a href='#f347' class='c013'><sup>[347]</sup></a> It was as a priest that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>exacted from the people the golden earrings they had won
from the Midianites in order that he might make with them
an image of his God. The Hebrew text has substituted for
the image the ephod which accompanied it.<a id='r348'></a><a href='#f348' class='c013'><sup>[348]</sup></a> But the ephod
was the linen garment of the priest, which he wore when
ministering, and with the help of which the future was divined.<a id='r349'></a><a href='#f349' class='c013'><sup>[349]</sup></a>
It was not the vestment but the image, in whose service the
vestment was used, that Jerubbaal set up in Ophrah, and after
which ‘all Israel went a whoring.’ Like his father, Jerubbaal
saw no idolatry where it was Yahveh of Israel who was represented
by the idol. The religious beliefs and practices of
Canaan had entered deeply into the soul of Israel; at Shiloh
alone was no image of its God.</p>

<p class='c003'>High priest among the Israelites, king among his Canaanitish
subjects, Jerubbaal lived long in his father’s home at Ophrah.
He acted like a king, even if he did not take the royal title.
Like Solomon, he had ‘many wives,’ and like Solomon also,
he built a sanctuary attached to his own house.<a id='r350'></a><a href='#f350' class='c013'><sup>[350]</sup></a> The Bedâwin
spoilers came no more: there was now a strong hand ruling
over the northern tribes of Israel, checking all tendency to
disunion, and building up an organised community.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the kingdom of Jerubbaal contained within it those
seeds of dissolution which have brought about the fall of so
many Oriental monarchies. They spring up, not among the
people, but in the family of the ruler. Polygamy brings with
it a curse, and the king is hardly dead before the children of
his numerous wives are murdering and fighting with one
another. Even during his lifetime the palace is honeycombed
with the intrigues of the harîm, which break out into open war
as soon as he has passed away. The family of Jerubbaal was
no exception to the rule. Abimelech, the son of his concubine,
a Canaanitess of Shechem,<a id='r351'></a><a href='#f351' class='c013'><sup>[351]</sup></a> conspired with his mother’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>kinsmen in Shechem, and taking seventy shekels of silver
from the temple of Baal-berith, hired with them a band of
mercenaries, who fell upon the other sons of Jerubbaal at
Ophrah and murdered them all save one. Alone of the
‘seventy’ brethren of Abimelech, Jotham, the youngest, hid
himself and escaped. The rest were slaughtered like oxen on
a block of stone. Abimelech then returned to Shechem, and
there under the sacred terebinth, which stood by the consecrated
‘pillar’ or Beth-el of the city, he was anointed king.
The garrison of the Millo, or fortress, of Shechem took part in
the ceremony.</p>

<p class='c003'>The report of Abimelech’s usurpation was brought to
Jotham. He left his place of concealment, and, standing on
the top of Mount Gerizim, upbraided the men of Shechem
with ingratitude towards Jerubbaal. He clothed his words
in one of those parables of which the East is the home.
‘The trees went forth,’ he told them, once on a time, ‘to
anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive-tree,
Reign thou over us. But the olive-tree said unto them,
Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour
God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? And
the trees said unto the fig-tree, Come thou and reign over us.
But the fig-tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness
and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the
trees? Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou and
reign over us. And the vine said unto them, Should I leave
my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted
over the trees? Then said all the trees unto the
bramble, Come thou and reign over us. And the bramble
said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you,
then come and put your trust in my shadow; and if not, let
fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of
Lebanon.’</p>

<p class='c003'>The moral of the parable was so obvious that it did not
need Jotham’s explanation to make it clear. He had been
bold in venturing near his enemies, and as soon as he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>finished speaking, he fled to a place of safety. Beer, ‘the
well,’ where he found a refuge, may have been the place of
that name in the extreme north of Naphtali.<a id='r352'></a><a href='#f352' class='c013'><sup>[352]</sup></a> Here at least
he would have been secure from pursuit.</p>

<p class='c003'>The usurpation of Abimelech was the revolt of the older
Canaanitish population against their Israelitish masters. It
marked the successful rising of the native element. Ophrah has
to make way for Shechem, and ‘the men of Hamor the father
of Shechem’ take the place of the children of Jacob. Yet the
deliverance from the Midianites wrought by Jerubbaal had
been achieved as much for the benefit of the Canaanitish part
of the population as for the Israelites themselves. The
murder of his sons and the destruction of his family was a
poor requital for all that he had done for them. Jotham was
justified in prophesying that their own god Baal-berith would
avenge the broken ‘covenant,’ and that Abimelech and his
Shechemite conspirators would fall by one another’s hand.</p>

<p class='c003'>Before three years were ended the prophecy was fulfilled.
The ‘god’ of Shechem ‘sent an evil spirit between Abimelech
and the Shechemites,’ who began a plot against his rule.
Abimelech had withdrawn from the city and was living at the
otherwise unknown Arumah, the garrison and government of
Shechem being placed under the command of a certain Zebul.<a id='r353'></a><a href='#f353' class='c013'><sup>[353]</sup></a>
Perhaps the king had already begun to be suspicious of his
subjects; perhaps his retirement to another town had aroused
their jealousy. However it may have been, the Shechemites
openly set at naught his authority. Bands of brigands left
the city and infested the neighbouring mountains, where they
robbed all who passed that way. They were soon joined by
another band of bandits, under the leadership of Gaal the son
of Jobaal.<a id='r354'></a><a href='#f354' class='c013'><sup>[354]</sup></a> Under him the disaffection towards Abimelech
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>came to a head, and Gaal proposed that the citizens should
revolt against Abimelech and Zebul. Zebul, however, while
professing to be upon their side, sent messengers to Abimelech
and urged him to march against Shechem before it was too
late. Abimelech gave heed to the message, and Gaal’s forces
were defeated outside the city, and driven back within its
gates. Abimelech then pretended to retire to Arumah, and
the citizens accordingly once more went out to their work in
the fields. But the royal troops were really lying in ambush,
divided into three companies, two of which fell upon the
fellahin in the fields and massacred them; while the third, with
Abimelech himself at their head, rushed into the city through the
open gate. All day long the battle raged in the streets; then
the survivors fled to the ‘crypt’ of the temple of Baal-berith
which adjoined the Millo or fort.<a id='r355'></a><a href='#f355' class='c013'><sup>[355]</sup></a> By the orders of Abimelech
brushwood was brought from the neighbouring Mount
Zalmon, piled up over the entrance to the crypt and set on
fire. All who were inside, men and women, to the number of
about a thousand, perished in the flames. Shechem itself
was razed to the ground, and its site sown with salt. For a
time the old Canaanitish city disappeared from the soil of
Palestine.</p>

<p class='c003'>The destined punishment had now fallen upon Shechem;
it was not long before it fell also upon its destroyer. The
town of Thebez had shared in the revolt of Shechem, and
Abimelech’s next action was to besiege it. The town itself
offered little resistance, but there was a ‘strong tower’ within
it, to which its defenders fled for refuge. Abimelech again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>had recourse to fire. But while the wood was being laid
against the gate of the tower, a woman on the parapet above
threw a broken millstone upon his head and shattered his
skull. The king felt himself dying, and besought his armour-bearer
to thrust a sword through his body, lest it might be
said that he had been slain by the hand of a woman. But
the request was made in vain, and future generations remembered
that the last king of Shechem, the murderer of his
brethren, had perished ignominiously by a woman’s hands.<a id='r356'></a><a href='#f356' class='c013'><sup>[356]</sup></a>
With Abimelech the sovereignty of the house of Joash seems
to have come to an end. We hear no more of Jotham, or of
any other attempt to found a monarchy among the northern
tribes. The first endeavour to organise Israel into a state had
but little success. Once more the old elements of disorder
and disunion reigned supreme. The tribes stood further and
further apart from each other, and mutual jealousies led to
intestine wars. The influence of Ephraim and of the sanctuary
of Shiloh grew daily less, and the power of the northern tribes
waned at the same time. The Israelites on the eastern side
of Jordan began to forget that they had brethren on its western
bank; Reuben is lost among the Bedâwin of Moab, and
Gilead and Ephraim engage in interfraternal war. Meanwhile
a new tribe is rising in the south. Judah has absorbed
Simeon and the Kenizzites of Hebron; the few relics of Dan
which have been left in the neighbourhood of Zorah have
become Jews in all but name, and the Kenites and the Jerahmeelites,
and the other foreign settlers in the Negeb have
followed the example of the Kenizzites. A common enemy
and a common danger has thus forced them together.</p>

<p class='c003'>The enemy were the Philistines. In the early days of the
Hebrew settlement in Canaan the Philistines had already
made the raids inland which had been checked, if not suppressed,
by Shamgar ben-Anath. For a time they had remained
quiet in their five cities of the coast. But fresh immigrants
from Krete or other Ægean lands introduced new blood and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>warlike energy. Once more their armed bands marched
forth to plunder and destroy. This time they are no longer
contented with mere raids; they now aim at conquest.
Hardly have the Canaanites been subjugated after long
generations of struggle, when the Israelites are called upon to
meet a new foe. It is a foe, moreover, which is not enervated
by centuries of luxury and culture, not accustomed to foreign
rule or divided within itself, but a hardy nation of pirates
whose whole life has been passed in fighting, and in seizing
the possessions of others.</p>

<p class='c003'>The first brunt of the Philistine attack was borne by Judah.
But it was not long before the armies of the Philistines made
their way northwards, and even penetrated into the fastnesses
of Mount Ephraim.<a id='r357'></a><a href='#f357' class='c013'><sup>[357]</sup></a> Of all this, however, the record has
been lost. The compiler of the book of Judges failed to find
it in the fragmentary annals of the past, and has been compelled
to fill up the interval between the fall of the kingdom of
Manasseh and the supremacy of the Philistines in Palestine
with notices of judges and events whose exact place in
Hebrew history was uncertain.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is here, accordingly, that we have the names of the so-called
lesser Judges, of whom little more was known than the
names. Two of them, Tola the son of Puah, and Elon, belonged
to Issachar and Zebulon; and it is somewhat singular
that while the book of Numbers makes Tola and Puah the
heads of families in Issachar, it makes Elon the head of a
family in Zebulon.<a id='r358'></a><a href='#f358' class='c013'><sup>[358]</sup></a> Of Tola we are told that he lived and
died at Shamir in Mount Ephraim, which at that time therefore
must have been in the hands of Issachar, and that he
judged Israel twenty-three years. The account of Elon is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>equally laconic; he judged Israel ten years, and was buried at
Aijalon in Zebulon. Another judge in Zebulon was Ibzan of
Beth-lehem,<a id='r359'></a><a href='#f359' class='c013'><sup>[359]</sup></a> who was judge for seven years only, but of whom
it was recorded that he had thirty sons and thirty. daughters.
A similar record has been handed down of another of these
minor judges, Abdon the son of Hillel. He, it is said, had
forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy colts.
Abdon was judge for eight years, and ‘was buried at Pirathon
in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.’ This
statement seems to push back the date of Abdon to an early
period when Benjamin had not yet separated from the
‘House of Joseph,’ and ‘the land of Ephraim’ accordingly
extended southwards into the Amalekite region. It would be
of the same age as that of the Song of Deborah.</p>

<p class='c003'>Gilead also had its judges, though the names of only two of
them have been preserved. One was Jair, who ruled as judge
for twenty-two years, and who ‘had thirty sons that rode on
thirty ass-colts, and they had thirty cities which are called the
villages of Jair.’ We hear something more of this Jair in the
Pentateuch. He had taken the villages which were called
after his name, and must have lived not long after the Israelitish
conquest of Bashan.<a id='r360'></a><a href='#f360' class='c013'><sup>[360]</sup></a> He belongs, therefore, to the earliest
period of Israelitish history in Canaan, and may have been
a contemporary of Joshua himself.</p>

<p class='c003'>The second judge left a more famous record behind him.
This was Jephthah, who delivered Gilead from its bondage to
the Ammonites. His father’s name was doubtful, his mother
was a harlot, and ‘the elders’ of Gilead accordingly expelled
him from what he claimed to be his father’s house.<a id='r361'></a><a href='#f361' class='c013'><sup>[361]</sup></a> He fled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>to the desert land of Tob,<a id='r362'></a><a href='#f362' class='c013'><sup>[362]</sup></a> and there gathering a band of
bandits around him, lived on the spoils of brigandage. He
soon became known, like David in later days, for his skill and
courage in deeds of arms. For eighteen years the Ammonite
domination had lasted, and the Gileadites sighed for independence.
But it was long before a champion could be found.
At last the fame of the bandit captain in Tob reached the ears
of the Israelitish elders, and they begged him to come to their
help. Jephthah taunted them with their conduct towards
him, but feelings of patriotism finally prevailed, and he agreed
to lead his followers against the national enemy if the Gileadites
would promise to make him their ‘head.’ The representatives
of the people had no choice but to agree to his
terms, and the struggle for independence began. It ended in
the deliverance of the Israelites; the Ammonites were again
driven from the land which had once been theirs, and Gilead
was free.<a id='r363'></a><a href='#f363' class='c013'><sup>[363]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The rejoicings over the victory, however, were clouded by
the rash vow of the Israelitish chieftain. Before marching
forth to attack the Ammonites, Jephthah had vowed to sacrifice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>as a burnt-offering to Yahveh whatever first came out of his
house at Mizpeh to meet him should he return ‘in peace.’
It was his own daughter, his only child, who thus came forth
to meet him, and to celebrate his victory with timbrels and
dances. The spirit of the Gileadites was very far removed
from that which had taught Abraham a newer and better way;
the Canaanite belief was strong in them that their firstborn
could be claimed by their God; and none questioned that
Yahveh Himself had selected the victim and led her forth
from the house to welcome the conqueror. The vow had to
be fulfilled; Yahveh had claimed that which was nearest and
dearest to the Gileadite chief in return for the victory He had
given him. All Jephthah could do was to grant his daughter’s
request that she might wander for two months in the mountains
with her comrades, bewailing ‘her virginity,’ before the
day of sacrifice arrived.</p>

<p class='c003'>The memory of the sacrifice was never forgotten. It
became a custom in Israel, we are told, for the Israelitish
maidens year by year to ‘lament’ for four whole days the
daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite. It has been maintained
that this custom was the origin of the story, and that the
lamentation was not for the daughter of a Hebrew judge, but for
some mountain goddess who corresponded with the Phœnician
god Adonis. As the maidens of Phœnicia once each year
mourned the death of Adonis, so the maidens of Gilead bewailed
the untimely death of a virgin goddess. But the
theory is part of that reconstruction of ancient Israelitish
history, one of the postulates of which is that a custom has
never arisen out of a historical incident. The historian, on the
other hand, finds in the story evidences of its truth. There is
no trace elsewhere of such a goddess as the story demands, or
of an anniversary of lamentation in her honour, while the
account of the vow and its fulfilment is in thorough harmony
with the beliefs and customs of the time. It is wholly contrary
to the spirit of later Israel as well as to the feelings of
those who adhered faithfully to the Mosaic Law. If the story
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>were an invention, it must have originated either in the days
when human sacrifice was still practised, or else in the later
period when it was regarded with abhorrence. In either case,
its invention would be inconceivable. In the earlier period
there would have been no reason to invent what actually took
place; in the later period, the character of a judge and
deliverer of Israel would never have been needlessly blackened.
Moreover, the belief that the first thing met with on
leaving or entering a house is unlucky and devoted to the
gods, is a belief which is probably as old as humanity. It still
survives in our own folklore, and testifies to a time when he who
first left the protection of the hearth and threshold could be
claimed by the powers of the other world.</p>

<p class='c003'>Jephthah’s term of office as ruler of Gilead was only six
years. He seems to have been already advanced in years
when he was called upon to oppose the Ammonites. But his
rule was signalised by a war with Ephraim. The ever-increasing
dissensions between the tribes on the eastern and western
sides of the Jordan came openly to a head, and the elder and
younger branches of the house of Joseph engaged in a struggle
to the death. Ephraim, it seems, still claimed predominance,
and asserted its right to interfere in the concerns of its eastern
brethren. ‘Ye Gileadites,’ it was said, ‘are fugitives of Ephraim
among the Ephraimites and among the Manassites.’ But the
‘fugitives’ soon proved that they were the stronger of the
two. The Ephraimites invaded Gilead, but were compelled to
retreat. Before they could reach the Jordan Jephthah had
seized the fords across it, and the retreat of the Ephraimites
was cut off. A terrible massacre took place; whoever said
<i>sibboleth</i> for <i>shibboleth</i>, ‘river-channel,’ was thereby known to
belong to the western bank, and was at once put to death.
Altogether 42,000 men of Ephraim perished, and the power
of the tribe was broken. Jephthah, however, did not follow
up his success; that would have brought upon him the hostility
of the other western tribes, and he seems to have returned to
Gilead. There he died and was buried in one of its cities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>the name of which was not stated in the sources used by the
compiler of the book of Judges.<a id='r364'></a><a href='#f364' class='c013'><sup>[364]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The date of Jephthah it is impossible to fix. That the
author of the book of Judges was ignorant of it would appear
from his making Jephthah follow immediately after Jair. But
it is clear that he believed it to have been towards the close of
the period of the Judges. This, too, would agree with the
fact that it corresponded with the fall of the power of Ephraim.
In the time of Jerubbaal, the Ephraimites were still strong
enough to command the respect of the conqueror of the
Midianites; when the light once more breaks upon the history
of central Israel we find the Philistines in possession of the
passes that led into Mount Ephraim, and threatening Shiloh
itself. The destruction of the Ephraimite forces at the fords
of the Jordan can best explain the Philistine success.</p>

<p class='c003'>With the period of the Philistine supremacy the history of
the Judges comes to an end. That supremacy forced Israel
to the conviction that they must either submit to the organised
authority of a king or cease to be a nation at all. The kingdom
of Israel was born amid the struggle with the Philistines;
and though the first king perished in the conflict, his successor
succeeded in founding an empire.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Philistine wars lasted for many years. They began with
raids on the Israelitish territory immediately adjoining that of
the Philistines. Perhaps the conquest of the plain at the foot
of the mountains of Judah first roused their hostility against
Judah; at all events, it brought them into contact with the
conquering tribe. A desultory warfare was carried on for
some years; then the plans of the Philistines became more
definite, and they aimed at nothing less than the conquest of
the whole of Canaan. The sea-robbers had been gradually
changed into a nation of soldiers.</p>

<p class='c003'>Samson, the hero of popular tradition, belongs to the earlier
part of the Philistine wars. The last relics of the tribe of Dan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>in the neighbourhood of Zorah and Eshtaol have not as yet
been absorbed by Judah; the Philistines, on the other hand,
have gained possession of the whole plain. Between them and
the Israelites there is constant intercourse, partly friendly,
partly hostile; at one time the two peoples intermarry, visit,
and trade with one another; at another time they carry on a
guerilla warfare.</p>

<p class='c003'>Of late years it has been the fashion to transform Samson
into the hero of a myth.<a id='r365'></a><a href='#f365' class='c013'><sup>[365]</sup></a> It is true that his name is derived
from <i>Shemesh</i>, ‘the sun,’ and it cannot be denied that the stories
relating to him have come rather from popular tradition than
from written records. His hair, in which his strength lay,
reminds us of the face of the sun-god engraved on the platform
of the Phœnician temple of Rakleh on Mount Hermon,
where the flaming rays of the sun take the place of human
hair. But it must be remembered that Samson is represented
as a Nazarite—a purely Israelitish institution between which
and a solar myth there is no connection—and that his strength
was dependent on the keeping of the vow which consecrated
him to Yahveh as a Nazarite from the day of his birth. With
the loss of the hair the vow was broken, the consecration at an
end; the strength had been given by Yahveh, and Yahveh
took it away. Between this and the fiery locks of the sun-god
there is but little connection.</p>

<p class='c003'>The character of Samson, however, is that of a hero of
popular tradition. His utter ignoring of moral principles, his
hankering after foreign women, his riddle, his devices for
deceiving and slaying his enemies, belong to the tales told by
the Easterns at the door of a <i>café</i>, or around the camp-fire,
rather than to sober history. When we hear that Ramath-lehi
was so called from the ‘jawbone’ of an ass which Samson had
‘flung away’ after slaying a thousand men with it, or that Ên-hakkorê
received its name from the water which flowed from
the bone to quench the hero’s thirst, we find ourselves in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>presence of those etymological puns with which the historian
has nothing to do.<a id='r366'></a><a href='#f366' class='c013'><sup>[366]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The compiler of the book of Judges has turned this hero of
popular story, this lover of Philistine women, into a Judge of
Israel. He was, however, merely a Danite champion, the one
hero of Danite tradition, of whom indeed the tribe had little
reason to be proud. Even in Judah his achievements gained
him no honour. When the Philistines sought to seize him
after he had burnt their corn, ‘three thousand men of Judah’
ascended to his place of refuge ‘on the top of the rock Etam’
and handed him over to his enemies. The wiles of a Philistine
harlot deprived him of his strength and his eyes, and he ended
his days as a fettered slave at Gaza, grinding wheat for his
Philistine lords. The glory of his death, however, in the eyes
of his fellow-tribesmen redeemed the rest of his life. Called
to make sport for his masters in the temple of Dagon, while
they feasted in honour of their god, he laid hold of the two
central columns on which the building was supported, and
brought it down on the assembled crowd. Samson and the
Philistines alike were buried under its ruins. And ‘so,’ the
chronicler adds, ‘the dead which he slew at his death were
more than they which he slew in his life.’</p>

<p class='c003'>In the story of Samson we hear for the first and the last
time in the book of Judges of ‘the men of Judah.’ It is the
first time that they appear in history. Judah produced no
Judges, for Othniel was a Kenizzite, and throughout the
epoch of the Judges its history is a blank. Nothing can
show more clearly how modern a tribe it was as compared with
the other tribes of Israel, and how insignificant was the power
which it possessed. The original Judah had its home at
Beth-lehem, shut in between the Jebusite Jerusalem and the
Edomite Hebron, and it was not until it had absorbed and
coalesced with the other occupants of its future territory that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>the Judah of history was born. It is possible that the union
was brought about, or at all events completed, by the Philistine
wars; at any rate we find no traces of it at an earlier date.
Even Lachish had been an Ephraimitic conquest, and in the
time of Deborah it must still have been reckoned among the
cities of Ephraim.<a id='r367'></a><a href='#f367' class='c013'><sup>[367]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Ephraim was yet to have a judge, the last of the race.
Though the title must be denied to Samson, it must be given
to Samuel the seer. In Samuel the judges and the prophets
of Israel met together, and the spirit of Yahveh which had
marked out the judge now passed over into the prophet.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the history of Samuel is not contained in the book of
Judges. We have to look for it in a new book which records
the foundation of the Israelitish kingdom. The books of
Samuel take their name from that of the prophet which appears
on their first page. They begin, however, with the conjunction
‘And,’ and thus presuppose an earlier volume. They are, in
fact, merely the continuation of the book of Judges. Whether
or not the same compiler has worked at the two books we
cannot tell; that is a question which must be left to the philological
critics who have long since settled his character and
date, and determined exactly the limits of his work.</p>

<p class='c003'>There is one fact, however, connected with the compilation
of the book of Judges which the historian cannot but notice.
The narratives embodied in it differ from one another in tone
and character. The religious point of view of the stories of
Jephthah or Micah is wholly different from that of the stories
of Barak or Jerubbaal. Between the account of the overthrow
of the Canaanites on the Kishon and the stories narrated of
Samson, there is the contrast between written history and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>folklore. Each narrative preserves its own individuality, its
own point of view, its own reflection of the age and locality
to which it belongs.</p>

<p class='c003'>Here and there, indeed, the pen of the historian who has
collected and combined these fragments of the past history of
Israel can be clearly traced. The speeches sometimes remind
us of those in Thucydides, and exhibit the colouring of a
later age. The framework of the narrative, moreover, is the
writer’s own; in fact, he shows himself to be more than a
compiler; he is a historian as well. But with all this, the
narratives he has collected differ as much in character and
tone as they do in the events they record.</p>

<p class='c003'>What more convincing proof can we have of the faithfulness
with which he has reproduced his materials? In most cases
they have not even passed through the assimilating medium of
his own mind; instead of using his privilege as a historian he
has given them to us unchanged and unmodified. And yet
in many cases they must have shocked both his religious and
his patriotic sense. Whatever else he may have been, the
author of the book of Judges possessed a historical restraint
and honesty which is rare even among the modern writers of
Europe. He has given us the older records of his country
just as he found them.</p>

<p class='c003'>They were for the most part written records. The scribes
of Zebulon are alluded to in the Song of Deborah, and the
notices of the ‘lesser’ Judges have the same annalistic character
as the notices of the early kings of Egypt in the fragments of
Marretho. The Canaanites of Shechem, from whom Abimelech
was sprung, had been acquainted with the art of writing from
untold centuries, and the Canaanitish cities which were laid
under tribute by Manasseh and the neighbouring tribes contained
archive-chambers and libraries where the older literature
of the country was stored. It is only in the future territory
of Judah that we hear of a Kirjath-Sepher, ‘a town of books,’
being destroyed, and it is just this part of the country whose
history in the age of the Judges is a blank. Between Othniel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>the destroyer of Kirjath-Sepher and David the conqueror and
embellisher of Jerusalem, the name of no single Judge or hero
has been preserved. Samson belonged to the feeble relics of
the tribe of Dan, and the story of his deeds is the one narrative
in the book of Judges which betrays an origin in folklore
instead of written history.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Samuel was born, the Hebrew settlement in Palestine
had long been a matter of the past. Little by little Canaan
had passed into the possession of the Israelitish tribes. The
older population had at first been massacred, then laid under
tribute and amalgamated with the newcomers. The tribes
themselves had changed much. Some had disappeared, others
had grown at their expense. Ephraim, which from the first
days of the conquest had been the most powerful among them,
was now in a state of decadence, and a new force was rising in
the south in the shape of the mixed tribe of Judah. A few of the
Canaanite cities in the interior still remained independent, like
Gezer and Jerusalem, as well as all those on the Phœnician coast.</p>

<p class='c003'>The tribes had suffered from want of cohesion. The
attempt to found a monarchy in Manasseh had failed; it was
too local and limited, and served only to arouse the jealousy
of the tribes which lay outside it. It had done little more
than bring to light the dissensions and differences that existed
within Israel itself. The bond that connected the tribes had
become continually looser, and the ‘House of Joseph’ was
divided into hostile factions. Benjamin had been decimated
by its brother Israelites under the leadership of Ephraim, and
Ephraim had undergone the same treatment at the hands of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>its brethren from Gilead. The conquest of Canaan had
brought with it the old Canaanitish spirit of disunion and
discord; the spectacle which the Tel el-Amarna letters present
to us of city arrayed against city is reproduced in the Israel
of the period of the Judges. The common brotherhood,
which was still felt in the age of Deborah, tended to be forgotten.
The tribes no longer come to one another’s aid;
they fight with one another instead. The authority of the
Judges become more and more circumscribed, their jurisdiction
more and more confined. The tribes on the east of the
Jordan begin to lead a separate life, and hardly acknowledge
that the tribes to the west are kinsmen at all. The incorporation
of the Canaanite element had weakened the recollection
of a common descent, and at the same time had introduced
into Israel a spirit of selfish isolation. The causes which had
brought about the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites were
now working among its conquerors, and it seemed as if the
fate of the Canaanites was to be the fate of the Israelites also.</p>

<p class='c003'>The sanctuary at Shiloh still existed, but it had lost much
of its influence. It had become little more than the local
sanctuary of Ephraim,<a id='r368'></a><a href='#f368' class='c013'><sup>[368]</sup></a> and as the power of Ephraim waned
the influence of Shiloh declined as well. Elsewhere rival
sanctuaries and rival forms of worship had arisen. The
high-places, whereon the Canaanites had adored Baalim and
Ashtaroth, still continued sacred, and though officially the
Baal of Israel was Yahveh, the mass of the people worshipped
the local Baal of the place in which they lived. Yahveh was
scarcely remembered, even in name: His place was taken
by the Baalim and Ashtaroth of Canaan. Manasseh went
‘a whoring’ after the golden image erected by Jerubbaal in
Ophrah, or after the Canaanitish Baal-berith in Shechem; a
rival priesthood to that of Shiloh served before the idols of
Micah at Dan; and Jephthah sacrificed his daughter in
accordance with Canaanitish beliefs. The Law of Moses was
forgotten; each man did that which was right in his own eyes.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>Modern criticism has asked how it is possible that all this
could have been the case if a written Law actually existed.
But the question forgets to take account of the circumstances
of the time. A knowledge of reading and writing was confined
to a particular class, that of the scribes; Israel was
divided; intercommunication was difficult, and a Law which presupposed
a camp of nomads continually under the eye of their
legislator, was not adapted to the changed conditions in which
the Israelites found themselves. Moreover, it must be remembered
that the Israelites were for the most part a peasantry
living in scattered villages; the inhabitants of the towns were
Canaanites either by race or marriage. The one were too ignorant,
the others too alien, to be affected by the Mosaic Code.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nevertheless, the Code was preserved at Shiloh. Here
there was an Aaronic priesthood, and the few notices that we
possess of the worship carried on there show that it was in
accordance with the Mosaic Law. Outside Shiloh, among
those who still remained true to the faith of their fathers, the
Law was remembered and presumably observed. Of this the
Song of Deborah is a witness. The God of Israel, in whose
name Barak and Deborah went forth against the heathen, is
the Yahveh of the Pentateuch, not the Baal of Canaan. The
history of Israel in the age of the Judges is, religiously as well
as politically, the history of degeneracy, not of development.</p>

<p class='c003'>In fact, religion and politics cannot be separated one from
the other in the history of the ancient East, least of all in the
history of the Hebrews. The one presupposes the other, and
the political decay of the nation is a sure sign of its religious
retrogression. The same causes which broke up its political
unity broke up its religious unity as well. The knowledge
and worship of Yahveh lingered in Ephraim, because in
Ephraim alone the old ideal and spirit of Israel continued to
survive. Ephraim was, as it were, the heart and core of
Israel; it had led the attack upon Palestine, and its blood
was purer than that of the other tribes. It remained more
genuinely Israelite, with less admixture of foreign blood.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>After Joshua and Othniel the history of most of the Judges
is connected with that of Ephraim. Ehud is a Benjamite—the
Ephraimitic ‘Southerner’; Shamgar is referred to in
the Song of Deborah;<a id='r369'></a><a href='#f369' class='c013'><sup>[369]</sup></a> Deborah herself dwelt near ‘Beth-el
in Mount Ephraim’; between Ephraim and Jerubbaal, who
reigned on the Ephraimitic frontier, there was smothered
hostility, which burst into open war in the case of Jephthah;
Tola was buried in ‘Shamir in Mount Ephraim’; Abdon was
an Ephraimite; while Ibzan and Elon came from adjoining
tribes. Jair the Manassite, and Samson from ‘the camp of
Dan,’ are the sole exceptions to the rule. What else can this
mean except that such annals as survived the stormy age of
the Judges were preserved amid the fastnesses of Mount
Ephraim? The scribes of early Israel were not confined to
Zebulon, and as in Babylonia or Egypt, so also in Palestine,
the temple was the seat of the library. In the sanctuary at
Shiloh the written records of the country would have found a
safe harbourage along with the tables of the Law and the
other monuments of the Mosaic age.<a id='r370'></a><a href='#f370' class='c013'><sup>[370]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The lifetime of Samuel separated the age of the Judges
from that of the Kings. It marked the transition from a
period of anarchy and disunion to one of order and organised
unity under a single head. But never had the fortunes of
Israel seemed so desperate. Disunited, with its former leader,
Ephraim, disabled and half-exterminated through civil war,
it had become the prey of a foreign enemy. The Philistines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>were no longer content with raiding expeditions. They now
occupied the districts they overran, and built forts to secure
the passes that led into the very heart of the Israelitish
territory.<a id='r371'></a><a href='#f371' class='c013'><sup>[371]</sup></a> Their supremacy extended from one end of
Palestine to another, and so gave a name to the country
which it never afterwards lost. The tribes were reduced to a
condition of serfdom; they ceased to be free men who could
go forth with arms in their hands to fight their foes; and were
compelled, as in the subsequent days of Chaldæan domination,
to confine themselves to tilling the soil. The wandering
smiths, the Kenite gypsies, were driven from the land; the
Israelite was deprived of all warlike weapons, and was forced
to go to the nearest Philistine post if he wished merely to
sharpen his implements of agriculture. The sons of Jacob
had almost ceased to be a nation.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was while Samuel was still young that the chief Philistine
victories were gained, and as he grew older the Philistine yoke
became heavier and more severe. In the general wreck, his
was the one prominent figure in Israel. To him the people
looked for counsel and help, and saw in him a prophet of
Yahveh. But Samuel was a man of peace, not of war. He
could not lead his people to battle, or check the rising tide of
Philistine success. Other men were wanted for the work,
and these were not forthcoming. Perhaps a time came when
Samuel himself was unwilling they should be found, and that
the authority he had possessed should pass to another. Such,
at least, is the impression we derive from his opposition to
the demand of the people that they should have a king.</p>

<p class='c003'>Samuel possessed, moreover, something more than personal
influence. He was the last representative of the ancient
sanctuary at Shiloh. He had been dedicated to it even
before he was born; he had grown up in it among the last
descendants of the earlier high-priests; he had seen the ark
taken from it to fall into the hands of the Philistines; he had
also witnessed, probably, the destruction of the temple itself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>All the older traditions of Mosaic worship gathered about
him; he was the living link in the chain which bound the
religious past of Israel with its present. In his person the
doctrines and practices which had been preserved at Shiloh
were handed on to the newer age of the kings.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Hebrew historian who put together the books of
Samuel was no longer embarrassed, like the compiler of the
book of Judges, by a want of materials. His embarrassment
arose from a contrary cause. The documents before him
relating to the history of the seer, to the rise of the monarchy
and the adventures of David, were numerous, and the same
event was sometimes recorded in different forms. He was
called upon to harmonise and combine them together, and he
doubtless experienced the same difficulty in doing so that
the Assyriologists at present experience in reconciling the
various accounts they have of the history of Babylonia in the
thirteenth century <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> That the latter can be reconciled, if
only we knew a little more, we cannot doubt; but for the
present the chronological inconsistencies seem irreconcilable.
All that can be done is to set them side by side.</p>

<p class='c003'>The compiler of the books of Samuel treated his materials
in the same way. The result is that the picture of the Hebrew
prophet which is presented to us is not always uniform in
its colours. Sometimes he is a priest, sometimes the judge of
all Israel, sometimes a mere local seer whose very name
appears to be unknown to Saul.<a id='r372'></a><a href='#f372' class='c013'><sup>[372]</sup></a> Throughout the greater
part of the narrative the Philistines are represented as the
irresistible masters of the country; once, however, we hear
that the cities they had captured were restored to Israel.<a id='r373'></a><a href='#f373' class='c013'><sup>[373]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>But it does not follow that because the colours of the picture
are not uniform, a fuller knowledge of the history would not
show that they are in harmony with one another. European
critics are apt to forget that in the East, and more especially
in the ancient East, conditions of life and society which are
incompatible in Europe may exist side by side. John, the
hermit of Lykopolis in Upper Egypt, was nevertheless on more
than one occasion the arbiter of the destinies of the Roman
Empire. And in the border warfare of Canaan cities passed
backwards and forwards from one side to the other with a
rapidity which it is difficult for the modern historian to realise.</p>

<p class='c003'>Whether Samuel was a Levite or an Ephraimite by descent
has been disputed. His father came from the village of
Ramathaim-zophim in Mount Ephraim, and was descended
from a certain Zuph, who is called ‘an Ephrathite.’<a id='r374'></a><a href='#f374' class='c013'><sup>[374]</sup></a>
‘Ephrathite’ signifies ‘a man of Ephraim’ (as in 1 Kings
<abbr title='six'>xi.</abbr> 26). But it also signifies a native of Ephratah or Bethlehem
in Judah (Ruth <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 2, 1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='seventeen'>xvii.</abbr> 12), and could
therefore signify any other place of the same name. That
there were other places of the name, the very name of
Ephraim, ‘the two Ephras,’ is a witness,<a id='r375'></a><a href='#f375' class='c013'><sup>[375]</sup></a> and we might
therefore see in the ‘Ephrathite’ merely a native of one of
them. The Chronicler (1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='six'>vi.</abbr> 26, 27, 33-38) definitely
makes Samuel a Levite, and traces his genealogy back to
Kohath. It is true that in the age of Samuel the priests, in
spite of the Mosaic law, were not always of the family of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>Levi—the fact that David’s sons were ‘priests’ is a sufficient
proof of this,<a id='r376'></a><a href='#f376' class='c013'><sup>[376]</sup></a>—but it seems hard to believe that such an
infringement of the Levitical tradition would have been permitted
at Shiloh. Nor is it likely that the genealogy given by
the Chronicler was an invention. Samuel had been in a
special manner the gift of Yahveh. His mother Hannah had
borne no children to her husband Elkanah, and was accordingly
exposed to the taunts of a second and more fortunate
wife. Once each year did the whole family ‘go up’ to Shiloh,
‘to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of Hosts.’ On
one of these occasions Hannah besought Yahveh with tears
that He would grant her a son, promising to dedicate him to
the service of the sanctuary should he be born. A Babylonian
tablet, dated in the fifth year of Kambyses, records a similar
dedication by a Babylonian mother of her three sons to the
service of the sun-god at Sippara.<a id='r377'></a><a href='#f377' class='c013'><sup>[377]</sup></a> In this case, however, the
sons did not leave their mother’s house until they were grown
up, when they entered the temple, where part of their duty
was to attend the daily service.</p>

<p class='c003'>Hannah’s prayer was granted, and a son was born. The
name which he received has no relation to the circumstances
of his birth, in spite of the etymology suggested for it in
1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 20, so long as we look only to its Hebrew spelling.
But if this spelling has been derived from a cuneiform original
all becomes clear. Samû-il in Assyrian would mean ‘God
hears,’ and there would thus be a fitting connection between
the name and the story of the prophet’s birth. The fact is
noteworthy, as it suggests that the history of Samuel was first
written in the cuneiform characters of Babylonia; and that the
cuneiform syllabary was used in Israel up to the time of the
fall of Shiloh.<a id='r378'></a><a href='#f378' class='c013'><sup>[378]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>As soon as the child was weaned he was brought to the
sanctuary along with other gifts. These consisted of meal and
wine, and three bullocks, one of which was slain at the time
of the dedication. ‘The priest’ who presided over the
services of the temple was old and infirm, and the management
of the sanctuary was really in the hands of his two sons,
Hophni and Phinehas. His own name was Eli. But he
comes before us without introduction; we know nothing
of his parentage and descent, and even the Chronicler
found no record of his genealogy. That he was a lineal
descendant of Aaron, however, admits of no doubt. This,
indeed, is plainly stated not only in the prediction of the
destruction that should overtake Eli’s house (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 14),
but also in the opening words of the prophecy of ‘the man of
God’ (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii.</abbr> 27, 28).<a id='r379'></a><a href='#f379' class='c013'><sup>[379]</sup></a> The very name of Phinehas,
given to Eli’s son, connects him with the line of Aaron and
the long bondage of the Israelites in Egypt. Phinehas is not
Hebrew, but the Egyptian Pi-Nehasi ‘the Negro,’ and could
have no sense or meaning in the Israel of the age of Samuel
except as an old family name.</p>

<p class='c003'>Samuel was clad in the linen ephod, the sacred vestment
and symbol of the priest, and ‘ministered unto Yahveh before
Eli.’ One night, before ‘the lamp of God’ had gone out
which burned before the ark of the covenant,<a id='r380'></a><a href='#f380' class='c013'><sup>[380]</sup></a> ‘the word of
the Lord’ came to the boy in his sleep. Three times did it
call to him, and then came the revelation of the punishment
which Yahveh was about to bring on the house of the high
priest.<a id='r381'></a><a href='#f381' class='c013'><sup>[381]</sup></a> His sons had been unfaithful to their office; not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>had they lain ‘with the women that assembled at the door
of the tabernacle of the congregation,’ they had made men
abhor the offering of the Lord, and the weak old man had
restrained them not. The law had ordained that the fat of
the sacrifice belonged to Yahveh, and that before it was
burned upon the altar neither priest nor offerer could receive
anything of the victim. Unless the law was complied with,
the sacrifice was useless; Yahveh had been robbed of His
portion, and no blessing could follow upon the offering. But
the sons of Eli persistently set at naught the strict injunctions
of the law. Before the fat was burned, their servant came
and struck his three-pronged fork into the flesh that had been
placed in the caldron, demanding that it should be given to
him raw. God’s priests thus mutilated the sacrifices that were
made to Him, and compelled His worshippers to defraud Him
of His due. The Israelites began to shrink from bringing their
yearly offerings to Shiloh, and the downward course of the religion
of Israel was hastened by the cynical greed of its priests.<a id='r382'></a><a href='#f382' class='c013'><sup>[382]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Eli had already been warned by ‘a man of God’ of the
coming vengeance of Yahveh. The prophet destined to play
so important a part in the history of Israel now appears almost
for the first time upon the scene. Deborah, indeed, had been
a prophetess, and a prophet had denounced the idolatry of his
countrymen during the period of Midianitish oppression; but
the spirit of Yahveh, which, in later days, revealed itself in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>form of prophecy, had hitherto rather inspired those upon whom
it had fallen to become leaders in war and ‘judges’ of their
people. Now it assumed a new shape. Out of the misery
and confusion produced by the Philistine raids sprang the first
great outburst of Hebrew prophecy. Those who still believed
Israel was the chosen people of Yahveh, and that He alone
was God over all the earth, were profoundly stirred by the
triumph of the uncircumcised. There was an outbreak of that
religious enthusiasm, degenerating at times into fanaticism,
which has occurred again and again in the East. The ‘seer’
took the place of the ‘judge.’ The waking visions which he
beheld revealed the future, and declared to him and the
people the will of Yahveh. The arms of flesh had failed; all
that was left was the ‘open vision,’ where the events of the
future were pictured beforehand, and men learned how to
escape disaster.</p>

<p class='c003'>Around the seer there gathered bands of disciples, closely
resembling the dervishes of to-day. They, too, received a part of
the prophetic spirit, and at times, under the influence of strong
emotions, passed, as it were, out of the body into an ecstatic
state. Like the modern dervishes, however, they were completely
under the control of the seer. At a word from him
their ecstasy would cease, and they would once more become
ordinary citizens of the world. But the spirit that moved
in them was easily communicated to religious or excitable
natures. The messengers sent by Saul to arrest David at
Ramah were themselves arrested by the spirit of prophecy
which permeated the home of Samuel, and when Saul himself
followed in his wrath, he, too, was suddenly overcome by the
same divine influence. ‘The spirit of God was upon him
also; and he went on and prophesied, until he came to Naioth
(the convent) in Ramah. And he stripped off his clothes also,
and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down
naked all that night.’</p>

<p class='c003'>But this ecstatic excitement was not of the essence of
Hebrew prophecy, and the latter soon divested itself of it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>The dervish element, indeed, remained almost to the last;
Elijah is a proof of it, and even Hosea and Isaiah still recur
at times to symbolic action. But it became subordinate and
purely symbolical, while the seer himself became a prophet.
The conception that gathered round him was no longer that
of a seer of visions, a revealer of the future, but of an interpreter
of the will of God to man. Prediction there might
be in his prophecies; but it was accidental only, and dependent
on conditions which were clearly expressed. If the
people repented of their sins, God’s anger would be turned
away from them; if, on the contrary, they persisted in their
evil ways, disaster and destruction would fall upon them. The
message of Yahveh was conditional; it did not contain the
revelation of an inevitable future.</p>

<p class='c003'>In this respect the Hebrew prophet was unique. His
name <span lang="hbo"><i>nâbî</i></span> is found in Babylonian, where it takes the form of
<i>nabium</i> or <i>nabu</i>, ‘the speaker.’ It was the name of the
prophet-god of Babylon, Nebo, the interpreter of the will of
Bel-Merodach, the supreme deity of the city. Nebo declared
to mankind the wishes and commands of Merodach; he was,
too, the patron of literature, the inventor, it may be, of writing
itself. The name of the mountain whereon Moses died is a
testimony that the worship of Nebo had been carried to the
West in the old days of Babylonian dominion in Canaan, and
we need not wonder that the word <i>nâbî</i>, with all that it implied,
had been carried to the West at the same time. But it was
not until after the age of Samuel that it made its way successfully
into the Hebrew language. Samuel was still the <i>roeh</i> or
‘Seer,’<a id='r383'></a><a href='#f383' class='c013'><sup>[383]</sup></a> though the Babylonian word in the form of a verb
(<i>hithnabbê</i>) was already applied to his ecstatic companions
who prophesied around him.<a id='r384'></a><a href='#f384' class='c013'><sup>[384]</sup></a> But the word answered to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>need. As the Hebrew prophet ceased more and more to be
a seer, it became necessary to find some new title for him
which should express more accurately his true nature, and the
word <span lang="hbo"><i>nâbî</i></span> was already at hand. The ‘seer,’ accordingly, fell
into the background; the ‘prophet’ occupied his place.</p>

<p class='c003'>We can trace the beginning of this great religious movement
in the age of Samuel. Samuel has often been called
‘the founder of the prophetic schools,’ and, to a certain extent,
this is true. But they were not schools in the sense of establishments
where his contemporaries could be educated in the
older literature of their country, and be trained to take upon
them the prophetic office. Schools of this kind were to come
later in the history of Israel. They did not even resemble the
early Christian monasteries of Egypt, where bodies of monks
lived together under a head, sometimes in a single building,
sometimes in a collection of separate cells. The earlier
disciples of Samuel were wandering bands of enthusiasts, over
whose religious ecstasies he exercised an exciting and a controlling
influence. They were men, to use a Biblical expression,
who were ‘drunk with the spirit’ of God.<a id='r385'></a><a href='#f385' class='c013'><sup>[385]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The loss of the ark and the destruction of Shiloh must
have quickened the movement which the Philistine troubles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>had begun. And it should be remembered that the ‘prophets’
among whom Saul was numbered were not all of them of the
Dervish type. Among them must have been men like Samuel
himself, the true predecessors of the prophets of later Hebrew
history. In the generation which followed, we find men like
Gad and Nathan, who have ceased to be seers and have become
the preachers of Israel, the conscience-keepers of the king himself,
and the chroniclers of his reign.<a id='r386'></a><a href='#f386' class='c013'><sup>[386]</sup></a> The literary traditions
of Shiloh passed to them through the hands of Samuel.</p>

<p class='c003'>The prophetic movement did something more than keep
alive a belief in Yahveh as the God of Israel. It preserved
at the same time the feeling of national unity. The ‘prophets’
who surrounded Samuel were drawn from all classes and from
all parts of the Israelitish territory. That Samuel was ‘established
to be a prophet of Yahveh’ was, we are told, known to
‘all Israel,’ ‘from Dan to Beer-sheba.’ That the statement
is not too general is shown by the history of Saul. All Israel
demanded a king, and it was over all the Israelitish tribes that
he ruled. As he owed his power to Samuel, it is clear that
the influence of Samuel also must have extended from one
extremity of the Israelitish tribes to another. Wherever the
Philistine supremacy allowed it, the authority of the seer was
recognised and reverenced.<a id='r387'></a><a href='#f387' class='c013'><sup>[387]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>But it follows from this that the veneration in which the
temple at Shiloh had been held was equally widespread.
Theoretically, at least, the Israelite acknowledged a central
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>sanctuary, where the sons of Aaron served before Yahveh, and
the prescriptions of the Mosaic law were observed. In
practice, it is true, the old Canaanitish high places, with their
local Baalim and Ashtaroth, had usurped the place of Shiloh;
private chapels had been set up in the houses of individuals,
and priests ministered in the sacred ephod before a graven
image. But all this was the natural fruit of an ‘age of ignorance,’
and later generations recognised that such was the case.
The purer worship of Yahveh was no ‘development’ out of
an earlier polytheism; it was simply a return to an ideal, the
memory of which was kept alive at Shiloh.</p>

<p class='c003'>And yet a time came when it seemed as if Yahveh had
forgotten the sanctuary wherein He had set His ‘name at the
first.’ The punishment denounced upon the house of Eli was
not slow in coming. Judah was already in Philistine hands,
and the enemy were now attacking the Israelitish stronghold
in Mount Ephraim. The Philistine camp was pitched at
Aphek, not far from Ramah, the birthplace of Samuel.<a id='r388'></a><a href='#f388' class='c013'><sup>[388]</sup></a> The
last relics of the Hebrew army were encamped opposite them
in a spot subsequently named Eben-ezer, ‘the Stone of Help.’
But it proved no help to them on this occasion. The Israelites
were defeated with a loss of about four thousand men, and in
their despair ‘the elders’ advised that the ark of the covenant
should be brought to the camp. Yahveh, it was believed,
enthroned Himself above it between the wings of the cherubim,
like the Babylonian Bel-Merodach, who on the feast of the
New Year similarly enthroned himself above the ‘mercy-seat’
in his temple at Babylon.<a id='r389'></a><a href='#f389' class='c013'><sup>[389]</sup></a> He would therefore be actually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>among them, visibly, as it were, leading their troops to victory
and blessing them with His presence. In the old days of the
conquest of Canaan, the ark had been carried before the camp
of Israel; the visible presence of ‘Yahveh of hosts’ had gone
with it, and the foe had been scattered before Him like chaff
before the wind.</p>

<p class='c003'>The ark was accordingly fetched from its resting-place at
Shiloh, and for the first time since the days of Moses and
Joshua the safeguard of Israel was seen by the common eye.
Despite the fears and reluctance of Eli<a id='r390'></a><a href='#f390' class='c013'><sup>[390]</sup></a> his two sons bore it
on their shoulders to the Israelitish camp. Its arrival was
greeted by a shout of joy which resounded across the valley to
the camp of the foe. Thereby the Philistines knew that the
God of the Hebrews had come in person to help his people
against their enemies as he had helped them in old days
against the Egyptians. But the old days were not to come
again. The ark had been carried out of its resting-place by
the command of the elders, not of Yahveh. Its sanctity had
been profaned, the mystery that surrounded it rudely stripped
away. It was only when it stood in its appointed place in the
Holy of Holies that the glory of the Lord rested upon it, and
Yahveh enthroned Himself between the wings of its golden
cherubim. The tabernacle and the ark were inseparable like
the casket and the treasure within it; either without the other
was forsaken of the Lord.</p>

<p class='c003'>The presence of the ark in the Israelitish camp availed
nothing. The Israelites fought with desperation, but without
a leader they were no match for the well-armed and well-trained
Philistine troops. Their army was cut to pieces; it
was said that thirty thousand of them were left dead on the
field. Worst of all, the two sons of Eli were among the slain;
the ark of Yahveh was captured by the heathen, and the way
lay open to Shiloh.</p>

<p class='c003'>A Benjamite fled from the slaughter to carry the evil tidings
to the high priest. Eli was ninety-eight<a id='r391'></a><a href='#f391' class='c013'><sup>[391]</sup></a> years old; his eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>were blind, and he was sitting on a bench at the entrance to
the temple, full of anxiety for the fate of the ark. The shock
of the news was more than he could bear; when he heard that
it had been taken by the Philistines he fell backwards, and his
neck was broken. A single day had deprived Israel of its ark
and of its priests.</p>

<p class='c003'>Hardly was Eli dead when his daughter-in-law, the wife of
Phinehas, was prematurely delivered of a child. He was born
on an evil day, a day when the light of Israel seemed
extinguished for ever. Throughout his life he bore a name
which prevented the terrible circumstances of his birth from
being forgotten. His mother called him I-chabod, ‘the glory
is departed,’ ‘for the ark of God was taken.’<a id='r392'></a><a href='#f392' class='c013'><sup>[392]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>I-chabod had an elder brother, Ahitub, born in happier
times.<a id='r393'></a><a href='#f393' class='c013'><sup>[393]</sup></a> Through him the line of Shilonite priests was continued,
and the high priesthood still remained in Eli’s house.
It was Ahitub’s grandson, Abiathar, who, after being the
faithful servant of David in his troubles, was banished and
deprived of the priesthood on Solomon’s accession.<a id='r394'></a><a href='#f394' class='c013'><sup>[394]</sup></a> But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>Ahitub must still have been young when the Philistines gained
the victory which laid all Palestine at their feet.</p>

<p class='c003'>The destruction of the temple at Shiloh must have been one
of the first results of the victory. The Israelites had no longer
an army, and the Philistine conquerors could march in safety
through the passes of Mount Ephraim. A fort was built by
them to command the pass at Michmash, and the old
sanctuary of Israel was levelled to the ground. No record of
its destruction, indeed, was known to the compiler of the
books of Samuel; it would have been strange, if in that hour
of distress and national disaster, when the storehouse of
Hebrew literature was itself destroyed, a chronicler should
have been found to describe the event. But the memory of
it was never forgotten, and it is alluded to both by the prophet
Jeremiah and by the Psalmist (Jer. <abbr title='seven'>vii.</abbr> 12, <abbr title='twenty-six'>xxvi.</abbr> 6; <abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr>
<abbr title='seventy-eight'>lxxviii.</abbr> 60).</p>

<p class='c003'>Such of the priests of Shiloh as survived the catastrophe
were scattered through Israel. In the time of Saul we find
eighty-five of them at Nob, which is accordingly called ‘the
city of the priests.’ Samuel himself fled to the home of his
fathers at Ramah. There as a seer and prophet, as the representative
of the fallen sanctuary of Israel, and as one of the
few literary men of the age, he became the centre of all that
was left of patriotism and national feeling in Israel. Gradually
his influence grew. Ahitub, the grandson of Eli, was young
like himself, and the destruction of Shiloh had deprived him
of such authority as his service before the ark of the covenant
would have conferred.</p>

<p class='c003'>The ark itself was once more within the confines of Israel.
It had been carried to Ashdod, and there placed in triumph
in the temple of Dagon. But the triumph was short-lived.
In the night, the image of Dagon twice fell from its pedestal
and lay on its face before the ark of the mightier God. On
the second occasion, it was broken in pieces by its fall; when
the priests entered the sanctuary in the morning, they found
the head and hands of their god rolled upon the threshold.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>‘Therefore,’ we are told, ‘neither the priests of Dagon nor
any that come into Dagon’s house tread on the threshold of
Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.’<a id='r395'></a><a href='#f395' class='c013'><sup>[395]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Dagon has been supposed to have had the shape partly of
a man, partly of a fish. But the supposition has arisen from
a false etymology of the name, which connects it with the
Hebrew <span lang="hbo"><i>dâg</i></span>, ‘a fish.’ We now know from the cuneiform
inscriptions that Dagon was really one of the primitive deities
of Babylonia adored there in days when as yet the Semite had
not become master of the land. Dagon was coupled with
Anu, the god of the sky, and when the name and worship of
Anu were carried to the West, the name and worship of Dagon
were carried there too. Sargon ‘inscribed the laws’ of Harran
‘according to the wish of the gods Anu and Dagon,’ and a
Phœnician seal in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford has
upon it the name of Baal-Dagon as well as representations of
an ear of corn, a winged solar disk, a gazelle, and several
stars. The ear of corn symbolises the fact that among the
Phœnicians Dagon, the brother of El and Beth-el, was the
god of agriculture and the inventor of bread-corn and the
plough.<a id='r396'></a><a href='#f396' class='c013'><sup>[396]</sup></a> But this was because in the language of Canaan
<i>dagan</i> signified ‘corn.’ In passing to the West the god thus
assumed new attributes, and became an agricultural deity who
watched over the growing crops.<a id='r397'></a><a href='#f397' class='c013'><sup>[397]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The power of the God of Israel was not shown only in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>humiliation of the Philistine god. The plague broke out in
Ashdod, accompanied by its usual symptom, hæmorrhoidal
swellings. The inhabitants of the city were not slow in
recognising in it the wrathful hand of Yahveh, and the ark
was accordingly sent to their neighbours in Gath. But here,
too, the plague followed it, and Ekron, to which it was sent
next, fared no better. For seven months the sacred palladium
of Israel remained in the hands of its captors. Then ‘the
priests and the diviners’ advised that it should be sent back
to the people of Yahveh along with offerings to mitigate the
anger of the offended God. Five mice and five hæmorrhoids
of gold were made and placed in a coffer by the side of the
ark. They represented the five Philistine cities, and the mice
were symbols of the wrathful Yahveh, the God of hosts and of
battle, who had wreaked his vengeance on the worshippers of
the peaceful god of agriculture. The mice which devoured
the corn were the natural foes of Dagon.</p>

<p class='c003'>The ark and the coffer were placed on a cart, and two
milch-kine were yoked to draw it. A doubt still lingered in
the minds of the Philistines whether the God who had allowed
his people to be conquered and his dwelling-place to be
captured could really, after all, have been the author of the
plague, and they watched, therefore, to see whether the kine
took the road towards Israelitish territory or back to their own
young. But all doubt vanished when the kine marched
straight eastward towards Beth-shemesh, lowing as they went.
The villagers were in the fields reaping when they saw the cart
coming towards them, laden with its precious freight. The
kine stood still at last by the side of a great stone—the stone
of Abel ‘in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite.’ Then the
Levites came and took the ark and the offerings from the cart
and laid them on the stone, which thus became a sanctuary
and an altar. The wood of the cart was broken into firewood,
and the kine were repaid for the gift they had brought
by being sacrificed to the Lord.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the plague followed the ark even upon Israelitish soil.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>The men of Beth-shemesh believed that it was because they
had looked into the sacred shrine of Yahveh, to see, possibly,
whether its original contents were still within it, and in their
terror they begged the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim to come
and carry it away. To Kirjath-jearim accordingly it was
removed and placed in the house of Abinadab, whose son
Eleazar was consecrated to look after it. That it was not
carried to Shiloh is a sign that the destruction of Shiloh had
already taken place.</p>

<p class='c003'>With the removal of the ark to Kirjath-jearim darkness falls
on the history of Israel. There was little for the patriotic
historian to record. The people were in servitude to the
Philistines, the national sanctuary had been destroyed, the ark
itself was hidden away in a private house. When the curtain
is again lifted, it is to chronicle a local success over the
Philistine foe. Samuel is at Mizpeh, ‘the watch-tower,’ which
must have adjoined Ramah, if indeed it was not the name of
one of its two quarters.<a id='r398'></a><a href='#f398' class='c013'><sup>[398]</sup></a> Here was the last refuge of the few
Israelites who still refused to acknowledge the Philistine rule,
and the surrounding mountains afforded a home and shelter
to the bands of outlaws who still carried on a guerilla warfare
with the foreigner. One of the incidents of this warfare was
long remembered. While Samuel was sacrificing a lamb as
a burnt-offering to Yahveh, the Philistines fell upon the
assembled people. But a sudden thunderstorm dismayed the
assailants, who fled down the valley towards Beth-car pursued
by the inhabitants of Mizpeh. It was in memory of the
victory that Eben-ezer, ‘the stone of help,’ was set up by the
seer between Mizpeh and Shen.<a id='r399'></a><a href='#f399' class='c013'><sup>[399]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>It would seem that no further attack was made upon
Mizpeh and its neighbourhood during the lifetime of Samuel.
At least such appears to be the conclusion we must draw from
the generalising and optimistic language of the Hebrew
historian.<a id='r400'></a><a href='#f400' class='c013'><sup>[400]</sup></a> For a time, indeed, the whole district was freed
from the presence of the foreigner. The villages eastward of
Ekron and Gath ceased to pay tribute to the conqueror,
though their independence could not have lasted long.<a id='r401'></a><a href='#f401' class='c013'><sup>[401]</sup></a>
Samuel’s ‘circuit’ did not extend beyond Mizpeh, Gilgal and
Beth-el, and his sons judged cases in Beer-sheba.</p>

<p class='c003'>Ahitub, the high-priest, was doubtless at Nob with the rest
of the Levites of Shiloh, almost within sight of Mizpeh. What
had been saved out of the wreck of the temple at Shiloh must
have been there with him. We know that at Nob the sword
of Goliath was subsequently laid up before Yahveh, and at
Nob too was probably preserved the brazen serpent that had
been set up by Moses in the wilderness.<a id='r402'></a><a href='#f402' class='c013'><sup>[402]</sup></a> According to the
Chronicler,<a id='r403'></a><a href='#f403' class='c013'><sup>[403]</sup></a> however, the tabernacle and the brazen altar
which had been made by Bezaleel were at Gibeon; how
this came to be the case he does not say.<a id='r404'></a><a href='#f404' class='c013'><sup>[404]</sup></a> At any rate, if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>brazen serpent were preserved, there is no reason why other
things should not have been preserved as well. And the
books of the Law would have been among the first objects to
be carried with them by the fugitive priests. We are told that
when the ark was brought into the temple of Solomon it still
contained the tables of stone which had been placed in it by
Moses (1 Kings <abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 9); if these had been removed from it
when it was taken to the Israelitish camp, they too must have
formed part of the temple furniture which was saved by the
priests.</p>

<p class='c003'>Here, therefore, in a small district of the tribe of Benjamin,
a portion of which was inhabited by the old Gibeonite natives
of the land, all that remained of Israelitish independence,
whether religious or political, found its last refuge. Here the
national spirit of Israel still lingered among the priests and
Levites who had fled from Shiloh, or who lived in the
mountains of Ephraim. It is not without significance that
here, too, was the home of the Gibeonite serfs of the sanctuary;<a id='r405'></a><a href='#f405' class='c013'><sup>[405]</sup></a>
priests, Levites, and Nethinim were gathered together,
as it were, in one spot. Though the temple had fallen, the
Mosaic Law and ritual were enshrined in the hearts of those
who had served in it.</p>

<p class='c003'>The destruction of Shiloh had restored to Beth-el its old
pre-Israelitish renown. Once more its high-place became
thronged with worshippers, and those who had formerly
carried their gifts and sacrifices to Yahveh at Shiloh, now
brought them instead ‘to God at Beth-el.’<a id='r406'></a><a href='#f406' class='c013'><sup>[406]</sup></a> At Beth-el,
accordingly, once each year Samuel offered sacrifice and
adjudged the cases that were brought before him, or predicted
the future to those who consulted him as a seer. It was at
a similar gathering at Mizpeh that the Israelites had been
attacked by the Philistines, and that the victory of Eben-ezer
had been gained.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the results of the victory were local and momentary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>and the condition of the Israelites had become intolerable.
Samuel, moreover, was growing old; his sons Joel and Abiah
were corrupt,<a id='r407'></a><a href='#f407' class='c013'><sup>[407]</sup></a> and his own influence was that of the seer
rather than that of the leader in war or the administrator in
peace. The only hope for Israel lay in its finding a chieftain
who could mould its shattered fragments into unity, could
organise its forces, and break the Philistine yoke. A new
Jerubbaal or Jephthah was required, but one who would
lead to victory not a few only of the tribes, but the whole of
Israel.</p>

<p class='c003'>The people demanded a king. Their instinct was right;
in no other way could the Israelitish nation be saved. Democracy
had been tried, and had failed: the end of the era of
the Judges was internal anarchy and decay, the destruction of
the central sanctuary, and servitude to the foreigner. Naturally
Samuel was reluctant to hand such powers as he still possessed
to another. His sons, doubtless, were more reluctant still.
Moreover, he had been brought up in the school of the past.
His boyhood had been spent at Shiloh under the influence of
ideas which saw in a theocracy the divinely-appointed government
of Israel.<a id='r408'></a><a href='#f408' class='c013'><sup>[408]</sup></a> At first he resisted the demand of the people.
But it was in vain that he protested against their rejection
of Yahveh and himself, or pointed out to them that the
establishment of a kingdom meant the loss of their personal
independence. The logic of events was too strong for the
seer, and he was compelled to yield. The time had come
when the choice lay between a king or national extinction,
and a king accordingly had to be found.</p>

<p class='c003'>Samuel yielded apparently with a good grace. In such a
matter the word of the chief seer and prophet of Israel was
law, and he knew that the selection was in his own hands.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>And he made it wisely and patriotically. Saul, the son of
Kish, the first king of united Israel, justified his election to
the crown. He saved Israel from destruction, and for a time
succeeded in rolling back the wave of Philistine domination.
His military capacities were unquestionable, as well as his
courage and devotion to his people.<a id='r409'></a><a href='#f409' class='c013'><sup>[409]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>But there was another side to his character, which perhaps
commended itself to Samuel quite as much as his military
abilities. A vein of deep religious fervour ran through his
whole nature, which at times degenerated into the gloomy
despondency of the fanatic. Rightly handled, he was capable
of high religious enthusiasm, and of  following his religious
guide with the simplicity of a child. But he could not brook
opposition; and, like all men of strong emotions, his hate was
as intense as his love. He was born to be the leader of his
countrymen, whether as a king or as a dervish the future had
to decide.</p>

<p class='c003'>Naturally he was a Benjamite, from that little corner of
Palestine which still remained true to the best traditions of
Israel. At first it seemed as if he was going to be the obedient
disciple of Samuel, a crowned addition to the group of dervish-like
prophets who surrounded the seer. More than one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>account of his accession to the throne of Israel has been
handed down, and it is not always easy to reconcile them.
One thing, however, is clear: Saul did not seek election, and
it came upon him as a surprise.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the tallness of his stature had marked him out from
among his companions; it was the outward token of superiority
which Yahveh had set upon him. His first meeting with
Samuel was accidental. He had been sent by his father<a id='r410'></a><a href='#f410' class='c013'><sup>[410]</sup></a> to
seek some asses that had strayed or been stolen, and, while
vainly engaged on his quest, was advised by his slave to
consult a seer who lived in the neighbouring town. The
town proved to be Ramah, and the seer to be Samuel, who
was that day offering a solemn sacrifice on the high place.<a id='r411'></a><a href='#f411' class='c013'><sup>[411]</sup></a>
Samuel invited him to the feast which followed the sacrifice,
and assigned to him the chiefest position among his guests;
then before his departure he secretly anointed his head with
oil, and declared that he was chosen to be ‘captain over
Yahveh’s inheritance.’ Next the seer told him where the
asses were that he sought, and bid him make his way to the
sacred circle of stones at Gilgal, and there remain seven days
until the prophet himself should come.</p>

<p class='c003'>Hardly had Saul quitted the presence of Samuel than he
was met by ‘a company of prophets’ coming down with music
and wild cries from the high-place of Gibeah.<a id='r412'></a><a href='#f412' class='c013'><sup>[412]</sup></a> Saul had not
yet recovered from the excitement of the strange and unexpected
scene in which he had just been an actor, and was in
no mood to resist the infection of the religious ecstasy which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>now seized upon him. He, too, like the spectators at a
modern <i>zíkr</i> in the East, joined the band of enthusiasts, and
added his voice to theirs. It was not until he reached the
high-place that his outburst of religious frenzy had spent itself.</p>

<p class='c003'>Such is one of the versions of the history of the foundation
of the Israelitish monarchy. Saul is anointed secretly by
Samuel, and at once enrols himself in one of the ‘prophesying’
bands of which Samuel was the spiritual director. According
to another version, his election as king took place in public at
a great assembly convened by Samuel at Mizpeh. Here the
lot fell upon Saul, who had hidden himself ‘among the stuff,’
and Samuel thereupon presented him to the people, who
shouted ‘Long live the king!’ Then the seer ‘wrote in a
book’ such regulations regarding the election and duties of a.
king as we find in the book of Deuteronomy (xvii. 14-20),
‘and laid it up before the Lord.’ As soon as the assembly
was dismissed Saul returned ‘to his house at Gibeah.’<a id='r413'></a><a href='#f413' class='c013'><sup>[413]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>His election, however, was not accepted unanimously,
consecrated though it had been by Yahveh. There were some
who failed to see in the tall enthusiast anything more than the
son of a yeoman at Gibeah. But a sufficient number of his
own tribesmen were ready to gather around him as soon as he
should summon them to battle. And the occasion was not
long in coming. Jabesh-Gilead, the old ally of Benjamin,
was beleaguered by Nahash, the Ammonite king. The city
was too weak to resist, and its inhabitants, offered to surrender.
But with Semitic ferocity Nahash answered that he would
spare their lives only on condition that the right eye of each
should be torn out. Seven days were granted them in which
to determine whether they should accept his terms or fight to
the death, and during the period of respite the elders of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>city sent to Benjamin to beg for help. Saul was ploughing
when the messengers arrived, and, fired with indignation, he
cut his oxen into pieces, which he sent throughout Israel with
the words: ‘Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after
Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen.’<a id='r414'></a><a href='#f414' class='c013'><sup>[414]</sup></a> The summons
still ran in the name of the old seer.</p>

<p class='c003'>Men came in from all sides, and Saul found himself at the
head of a small army. It is said that when he numbered his
troops at Bezek, ‘the children of Israel were three hundred
thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.’ Such may
have been the full fighting force of Israel before Saul’s reign
was ended; it cannot have represented the number of those
who were able to flock to his standard during the few days
that still remained for the relief of Jabesh. As elsewhere in
the Old Testament, the ciphers are largely exaggerated. Indeed
when we consider the size of the Assyrian army, as recorded
in the inscriptions, at a time when it was the most formidable
engine of destruction in Western Asia, it becomes clear that
the number of fighting men in the Hebrew army can never
have been very great. The three hundred and thirty thousand
men in Saul’s army are but an instance of that Oriental
exaggeration of numbers and inability to realise what they
actually mean, which is as common in the East to-day as it
was in the age of Samuel.<a id='r415'></a><a href='#f415' class='c013'><sup>[415]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>Jabesh was rescued, and the Ammonites were scattered in
flight. The victory was a proof of Saul’s military capacity,
and justified his choice as king. The news of it rang from
one end of Israel to the other, and the victorious soldiers
demanded the death of those who had questioned their leader’s
right to reign. But Saul refused the demand; no bloodshed
was to mar the glory of the day; from henceforth all true
Israelites were to be united in recognising their king. Yahveh
had chosen him at Mizpeh; it was now needful that he should
go to the sacred enclosure of Gilgal, the first camping-ground
of the Israelites in Canaan, and there be solemnly acclaimed
by the assembled multitude. As Joshua the Ephraimite had
started from Gilgal to conquer Canaan, so Saul the Benjamite,
the new ‘captain of the Lord’s inheritance,’ set forth also from
Gilgal to restore its fallen fortunes.</p>

<p class='c003'>A year had to pass before Saul felt himself strong enough
to attack the Philistine garrisons. By that time he had
collected three thousand Israelites about him, all of them
prepared to fight and willing to obey their leader. But they
were armed only with implements of agriculture, or such other
makeshifts for weapons as they could find. The Philistines
had forbidden the wandering blacksmiths to enter Israelitish
territory, and Saul and his son Jonathan, we are told, alone
possessed sword and spear. Out of the three thousand, one
thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah; the rest were with
Saul watching the road that led over the mountains from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>Michmash to Beth-el. There was a Philistine fort on the
hill above Gibeah, in the very heart of Saul’s own country;
another fort commanded the pass of Michmash and the
approaches to Ephraim.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Philistines seemed to have made a rising among the
Israelites impossible. Their forts and garrisons commanded
the roads, like the French garrisons in Algeria, and the conquered
population was forbidden the use of arms. Saul,
nominally the king of Israel, was in reality merely the chief
of a band of outlaws, desperately holding their own in the
fastnesses of the mountains, and protected by the sympathy of
the priests and the peasantry. The victory over Nahash had
confirmed Saul’s title to lead them among his own countrymen;
it had done nothing towards releasing them from the
domination of the Philistines.</p>

<p class='c003'>Now, however, Jonathan ventured to assail the Philistine
outpost at Gibeah. The attack was successful; the fortress
was taken and its defenders put to the sword.<a id='r416'></a><a href='#f416' class='c013'><sup>[416]</sup></a> It was open
revolt against the Philistine supremacy, and the news of it
quickly spread. Saul sent messengers throughout Israel, claiming
the success for himself and the monarchy, and formed a
camp at Gilgal. Meanwhile the Philistine army was on the
march to suppress the revolt. The Hebrew chronicler describes
it as consisting of ‘thirty thousand chariots and six thousand
horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore
for multitude,’<a id='r417'></a><a href='#f417' class='c013'><sup>[417]</sup></a> and it pitched its camp at Michmash, a
little to the north of Gibeah. Here it cut Saul off from all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>communication with the north, and threatened his rear. He
therefore left Gilgal and joined his son at Gibeah. Only six
hundred men remained with him; the rest had fled at the
approach of the enemy, who sent out three bands of raiders
from their camp, one of which marched in a south-eastward
direction towards the Dead Sea, while the other two turned,
the one to the north-west, and the other to the north-east.</p>

<p class='c003'>The mountainous district from which Saul drew his forces
was panic-stricken. The peasantry fled from their devastated
fields, and the whole country was given up to fire and sword.
Pure-blooded Israelites and Hebrews of mixed descent were
united in the common disaster. The one hid themselves in
the caves and forests, even in cisterns and grain-pits, while the
others took refuge in Gad and Gilead, on the eastern side of
the Jordan.<a id='r418'></a><a href='#f418' class='c013'><sup>[418]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>It was again Jonathan who brought deliverance to Israel.
Between the Israelites at Gibeah, and the Philistines at Michmash,
lay a deep gorge, usually identified with the Wadi
Suweinît.<a id='r419'></a><a href='#f419' class='c013'><sup>[419]</sup></a> On either side rose a precipitous crag of rock
which effectually cut off the hostile forces one from the other.
Across this gorge Jonathan determined to make his way,
accompanied only by his armour-bearer, and trusting in the
help of Yahveh of Israel. In broad daylight the two heroes
climbed the opposite cliff, in the face of the Philistines, who
believed they were deserters from the Israelitish camp. But
once arrived in the Philistine stronghold, they fell suddenly on
its unprepared defenders and slew about twenty of them
‘within as it were half a furrow of an acre of land.’ The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>Hebrew camp followers of the Philistines thereupon turned
upon their companions, and the camp of the Philistines became
a scene of confusion and dismay. Jonathan had said
nothing to his father of his intended exploit, but Saul soon
observed that fighting was going on in the enemy’s camp.</p>

<p class='c003'>Among the Israelitish fugitives with Saul was the high-priest
Ahimelech,<a id='r420'></a><a href='#f420' class='c013'><sup>[420]</sup></a> the great-grandson of Eli, who had joined the
king with the sacred ephod. The ark, too, had been carried
for safety into the Israelitish camp, and was once more
accompanying the army of Israel against its foes. When, therefore,
Saul had numbered his men and found that Jonathan
was absent, he called for the priest and bade him inquire of
Yahveh whether they should go to his help or not. But
before the question could be answered the tumult on the
opposite side of the valley made hesitation impossible. It was
clear that the moment had come for striking a blow at the
supremacy of the foreigner. The gorge accordingly was
quickly traversed, and the Israelitish king with his six hundred
followers threw himself on the enemy’s rear. The Philistines
resisted no longer. Attacked in front by the peasants who
had followed them, and in the rear by the soldiers of the
king, they fled precipitately up the pass to Beth-el.<a id='r421'></a><a href='#f421' class='c013'><sup>[421]</sup></a> The
victory was complete, and the Philistine forces would have
been annihilated had Saul’s religious convictions been less
fervent. But when the instinct of the general overcame the
zealot, and he had stayed the priest in the very act of consulting
Yahveh, he salved his conscience by a vow. None should
eat or drink until he had overthrown his enemies, and whoever
broke the royal vow should be devoted to death.</p>

<p class='c003'>The vow was rash and untimely, but it was registered in
heaven. The Philistines were pursued as far as Aijalon. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>Israelites were too weak from want of food to follow them
further. Jonathan alone, who had not been in the Israelitish
camp when the vow was made, ate a little honey which he saw
dropping from a tree. His companions looked at it with
longing eyes, but dared not follow his example. All the more
fiercely, therefore, did they fall upon the spoil which they
afterwards found in the Philistine camp. The sheep and
oxen and calves were slaughtered as they stood upon the
ground, ‘and the people did eat them with the blood.’ The
news of this violation of one of the primary laws of Israelitish
religion struck Saul with horror. He caused a great stone to
be rolled towards him, and on this improvised altar the animals
were slain. It was ‘the first altar,’ we are told, that Saul
‘built unto the Lord.’</p>

<p class='c003'>But worse was yet to come. Saul proposed to pursue the
Philistines in the night, and accordingly the oracle of Yahveh
was again appealed to. No answer, however, was returned to the
questioners. Neither priest nor ephod availed anything, and
it became clear that sin had been committed in Israel. When
the lots were cast, they fell upon Jonathan, who then confessed
that he had, in ignorance of his father’s vow, eaten a little
honey. The religious fanatic was stronger in Saul than the
father, and he pronounced sentence that Jonathan must die.
Jonathan, in fact, was the firstborn whose sacrifice was
demanded by Yahveh as the price of the victory. Fortunately
the religious convictions of the Hebrew soldiers were less
intense than those of their king. It was Jonathan to whom
the victory was due, and in the hour of his triumph they
refused to allow him to die. Saul yielded, perhaps willingly;
but the Philistines were permitted to disperse to their own
homes.<a id='r422'></a><a href='#f422' class='c013'><sup>[422]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>Was the sacrifice of Jonathan urged by Ahimelech and the
priests? They at any rate did not interfere to prevent it, and
the lots were cast under their supervision. What is certain is
that from this time forward there was an increasing estrangement
between Saul and the priesthood, which ended in the
secret anointing of David as king of Israel, and in the massacre
of the priests at Nob. We hear no more of Ahimelech and
the ark in the camp of Saul.</p>

<p class='c003'>Samuel, the aged and venerated representative of the
Shilonite priesthood, had much to do with this growing
estrangement. From the first he had looked upon Saul as a
rival who had robbed him of his former power. Even after
Saul had proved his fitness to rule by the rescue of Jabesh, and
had been publicly acclaimed king by the people at Gilgal, he
could not conceal his mortification and hostility. Were not
he and his sons still with them? he asked the assembled
Israelites; why then had they added this ‘wickedness’ unto
‘all their sins,’ to demand a king? In the thunder which
rolled overhead he bade them recognise the anger of Yahveh
at their thus rejecting His representative, and he ended with
the threat that both they and their king should be ‘consumed.’<a id='r423'></a><a href='#f423' class='c013'><sup>[423]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Samuel was not long in embodying his hostility in deeds.
According to one of the authorities used by the compiler of
the books of Samuel, seven days only had elapsed after Saul’s
election when the seer upbraided him in the presence of his
army and told him that Yahveh had chosen another king in
his place.<a id='r424'></a><a href='#f424' class='c013'><sup>[424]</sup></a> Here, however, two occurrences have been confused
together—Saul’s confirmation as king by the people at
Gilgal, and his subsequent encampment at the same place in
the second year of his reign. By this time the breach had
grown and widened between the old Judge and the new
‘Captain’ of Israel. Saul, in spite of his religious convictions
and excitability, had not shown himself the obedient disciple
and tool of Samuel that might have been expected; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>proved to have a strong and violent will of his own, which he
was fully ready to exercise when not under the influence of
religious excitement. It was only temporarily that Saul was
‘among the prophets.’ Nor did he possess that tact and
pliability which would have enabled David under the same
circumstances to avoid an open quarrel with the aged seer.
Saul was too earnest, too convinced that what he believed was
the truth, to understand a compromise, much less a course of
duplicity.</p>

<p class='c003'>That the incident at Gilgal is historical, there can be no
doubt. It is only the time of its occurrence that is misplaced.
It belonged to those days of danger and difficulty when the
Philistines seemed to have triumphed finally, and the hope of
Israel lay in the six hundred desperate men who still followed
Saul. Saul had waited vainly for the coming of Samuel, and at
length, tired of waiting, had offered the burnt-offering for the
safety and success of the army which Samuel had agreed to
present. Hardly had it been offered when the seer appeared.
Then it was that the king of Israel was told that he had been
rejected by the Lord, and that another had been selected in his
place. The occasion was indeed well chosen; the Israelites
were already sufficiently discouraged and inclined to believe
that their king had been even less successful against the
Philistines than Samuel and his sons. Under the rule of
Samuel, at all events, the territory of Benjamin had not been
devastated, and its inhabitants compelled to hide themselves
in the holes of the earth.</p>

<p class='c003'>Samuel returned from Gilgal to ‘Gibeah of Benjamin.’ The
victory at Michmash, which disappointed his predictions,<a id='r425'></a><a href='#f425' class='c013'><sup>[425]</sup></a>
changed the aspect of affairs, and Saul’s throne seemed now to
be firmly established. Once more, however, Samuel made an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>effort to shake it, and it was again at Gilgal that the event
took place. Saul’s power rested on his soldiery, and the
surest way, therefore, of striking at it was through the soldiery
in the camp of Gilgal.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was after an expedition against the Amalekites. The
Israelites had marched towards El-Arîsh and smitten the
Bedâwin of the desert ‘from Havilah’ in Northern Arabia to
the great Wall of Egypt.<a id='r426'></a><a href='#f426' class='c013'><sup>[426]</sup></a> They had brought back with them
a vast amount of spoil, as well as Agag, the Bedâwin chief,
‘everything that was vile and refuse,’ including the mass of the
people, having been ‘destroyed utterly.’ But this was not
enough. The Amalekites were to be treated as the Canaanites
had been by Joshua; they and all that belonged to them had
been laid under the ban and condemned to extermination.<a id='r427'></a><a href='#f427' class='c013'><sup>[427]</sup></a>
Samuel, therefore, went in haste to the Israelitish camp, and
there charged Saul with disobedience to the commands of
Yahveh. Saul’s plea that the cattle and herds had been saved
by ‘the people’ in order that they might be sacrificed to the
Lord, was not accepted, and the fierce old seer himself
‘hewed Agag in pieces before Yahveh.’ At the same time, he
told the Israelitish king that the kingdom had been rent
from him and given to a neighbour that was better than he.
It was the last time that the king and the seer met. Samuel
went back to his home at Ramah and Saul returned to Gibeah.
Between Saul and the priesthood there was open war.</p>

<p class='c003'>The attack upon the Amalekites implies that the Philistines
had for a time ceased to be formidable. The extract from the
state chronicles given in 1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 47-52 makes it follow the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>other wars of Saul. Among these wars we hear of one against
Moab, of another against Edom (or rather Geshur), and of a
third against ‘the kings of Zobah.’<a id='r428'></a><a href='#f428' class='c013'><sup>[428]</sup></a> The Aramæans of
Zobah, called Tsubitê in the Assyrian texts, and placed northward
of the Haurân, were beginning to be powerful, and as we
learn from the history of David, were about to establish a
kingdom under Hadadezer which extended to the Euphrates
and included Damascus. But at present they were still
governed by more than one chief.<a id='r429'></a><a href='#f429' class='c013'><sup>[429]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The campaign against Zobah makes it clear that Saul’s
authority was acknowledged in Gilead as well as on the
western side of the Jordan. It is not surprising, therefore,
that after his death his son should have resided there, well out
of the reach of the Philistines, or that Eshbaal’s kingdom
should have comprised all the northern tribes. Little by
little, in spite of the opposition of Samuel, Saul worked his
way to general acknowledgment and power. The Israelites,
for the first time, were welded into a homogeneous state, and
their enemies were kept at bay. The organisation of the
kingdom went hand in hand with the military successes of its
king. Israel at last was not only feared abroad, but at peace
and unity within.</p>

<p class='c003'>With all this, Saul preserved the old simplicity of his life and
manners. He never yielded to the usual temptations of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>Oriental despot; he had no harîm like David or Solomon, no
palaces, no gardens, no trains of cooks and idle servants.<a id='r430'></a><a href='#f430' class='c013'><sup>[430]</sup></a> The
people were not taxed to supply him with luxuries, nor dragged
from their homes for his buildings and wars. In some of
these royal pleasures doubtless he could not indulge: the conditions
under which he reigned prevented it. But it was only
by his own free choice that he remained faithful to one wife—Ahinoam,
the daughter of Ahimaaz,—and that he held court
at Gibeah under the shade of a tamarisk instead of a palace,
with a spear in his hand in place of a sceptre.<a id='r431'></a><a href='#f431' class='c013'><sup>[431]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Saul was a born soldier, and he had a soldier’s eye for
detecting those who could best serve him in war. He added
to his bodyguard all who were distinguished by strength or
courage, and the border warfare with the Philistines kept them
in constant employment. Among the young recruits was
David, the youngest of the eight sons of Jesse, a Jew of
Beth-lehem. Two different accounts have been preserved of
the way in which David was first introduced to the king. It
is difficult to reconcile them; the compiler of the books of
Samuel was content to set them side by side without attempting
to do so, while the Septuagint translators have cut the
Gordian knot by omitting large portions of one of them. The
difficulty is increased by the fact that the second account
makes David the conqueror of Goliath of Gath, who elsewhere
(2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 19) is said to have been slain during David’s
reign by El-hanan the Beth-lehemite.<a id='r432'></a><a href='#f432' class='c013'><sup>[432]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>According to this second story, the Philistines had invaded
Judah and pitched their camp on a mountain-slope between
Socoh and Azekah. Saul was encamped on the hill opposite,
and between the two armies was the valley of Elah at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>bottom of which was the dry bed of a mountain stream. The
three elder brothers of David were in the Hebrew army,
David himself having been left at home to look after his
father’s sheep. From time to time, however, he was sent with
loaves of home-made bread to his brothers and a present of
milk-cheeses to ‘the captain of their thousand.’ On one of
these occasions a Philistine giant, Goliath by name, came
forth from the camp of the enemy to challenge the Israelites
to single combat. He had done so day by day, but none of
Saul’s followers had ventured to accept the challenge. For
Goliath of Gath was a descendant of the ancient Anakim,
and of gigantic stature. His height, it was said, was six cubits
and a span, or nearly ten feet,<a id='r433'></a><a href='#f433' class='c013'><sup>[433]</sup></a> and the staff of his spear was
like a weaver’s beam, while its head weighed six hundred
shekels of iron. Like the Greeks, he wore not only a bronze
helmet and coat of mail, but also greaves on his legs; a
bronze shield was hung between his shoulders and a broad-sword
at his side.</p>

<p class='c003'>David offered to accept the challenge of the uncircumcised
giant, and in spite of his brothers’ ridicule his words were
repeated to Saul. As a shepherd he had already proved his
strength and daring by slaying both a lion and a bear; he was
now ready to face the Philistine and redeem the honour of
Israel. At first the Israelitish king insisted that he should be
armed, and he was accordingly equipped in the usual Hebrew
fashion with helmet, cuirass, and sword. But the young
shepherd felt restricted and awkward in these unaccustomed
accoutrements; nor did he know how to manage the sword.
He therefore stripped them from him, and boldly approached
the Philistine champion with his shepherd’s sling and five
‘smooth stones.’ These he knew how to wield, and with
such effect that one of the stones penetrated the forehead of
the Philistine, who fell dead to the ground. Then his conqueror
dissevered his head with his own sword, while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>Israelites shouted and pursued the panic-stricken enemy to
the gates of Ekron.<a id='r434'></a><a href='#f434' class='c013'><sup>[434]</sup></a> Saul had inquired in vain through
Abner, the commander-in-chief of the army, whose son the
young champion of Israel was; and it was not until David
had presented himself before the king, with the head of the
Philistine in his hand, that he learned from his own lips that
he was the son of his ‘servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.’</p>

<p class='c003'>David’s fortune was made; Saul at once incorporated him
in his bodyguard, and a warm friendship began between him
and Jonathan, a friendship that ceased only with Jonathan’s
death. David was fresh and handsome, with a charm of
manner and a ready tact which won the hearts of those he
was with. It was not long, therefore, before he became first
the favourite, then the general, and eventually the son-in-law
of the Israelitish king.</p>

<p class='c003'>The other account of David’s introduction to Saul brings
Samuel once more upon the stage. The ‘neighbour’ better
than Saul proves to be David, whom Samuel is accordingly
sent to Beth-lehem to anoint secretly. He goes there under
the pretence of wishing to offer a sacrifice, to which he invites
Jesse and his sons. The elders of the city receive him with
fear and trembling, and ask if he has come in peace. He is
known to be the enemy of the king, and his arrival in a city
of Judah bodes nothing good. The sons of Jesse are passed
in review before him; none of them, however, is approved,
and the seer asks if there is still no other. Thereupon Jesse
tells him that there is yet the youngest, who is in the fields
tending the sheep. Samuel bids him be sent for, and in spite
of his terror of Saul and the secrecy of his mission, anoints
the youth ‘in the midst of his brethren.’ Then the spirit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>Yahveh comes upon David, and an evil spirit from Yahveh
takes possession of Saul. Saul still reigns, indeed, but the
mystic power conferred by the consecration, which had given
him the right to do so, has henceforth passed to another.</p>

<p class='c003'>The ‘evil spirit’ shows itself in fits of moody depression,
which at times become insanity. Saul’s mind, always excitable,
loses its balance; he is oppressed by a settled
melancholy, which is now and again broken by outbursts of
ungovernable rage. His servants determine that the evil spirit
can be charmed away only by music, and one of them recommends
David, the Beth-lehemite shepherd, who is not only
a valiant ‘man of war,’ but also a skilful player upon the harp.
David is hereupon summoned to the court, where his harping
cures the king, who makes him his armour-bearer.</p>

<p class='c003'>Such are the two narratives of David’s introduction to Saul.
It is plain that they exclude one another. The king’s handsome
armour-bearer, who soothes his mind and banishes his
melancholy by music, cannot be the shepherd-lad who brings
the loaves of home-made bread to his brothers, and whose
very name and parentage are unknown to Saul and Abner.
And yet there are points in each narrative which seem to be
historical. It is true that in a later passage the death of
Goliath is ascribed to a certain El-hanan; but the passage is
corrupt, and though the Chronicler must have had an equally
corrupt text before him,<a id='r435'></a><a href='#f435' class='c013'><sup>[435]</sup></a> it is possible he may be right in
making the Philistine slain by El-hanan the brother of
Goliath. At all events, the fact that the sword of the giant
of Gath was preserved at Nob and was there handed over to
David on his flight from Saul, shows that the death of Goliath
must have happened while Saul was reigning and that David
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>had been the hero of the deed. The priest expressly says
that it was ‘the sword of Goliath the Philistine whom thou
slewest in the valley of Elah.’ On the other hand, David was
famous as a musician, and was even said to have invented
instruments of music (<abbr title='Amos'>Am.</abbr> <abbr title='six'>vi.</abbr> 5), while Saul’s fits of depression
were also historical; and the description given of David’s
appearance (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='sixteen'>xvi.</abbr> 12) is that of one who had seen him.
Perhaps the harp-playing before the king followed David’s
enrolment in Saul’s bodyguard, and was one of the means
whereby he gained the heart of his royal master.</p>

<p class='c003'>Are we to accept the anointing by Samuel as a historical
incident, or are the modern critics right in asserting that the
story is an invention, the object of which was to claim for
the founder of the Judæan monarchy the same consecration
at the hands of the great Hebrew seer as that which had been
bestowed upon Saul? That David was actually anointed by
a messenger of Yahveh admits of little doubt. Apart from
Psalm <abbr title='eighty-nine'>lxxxix.</abbr> 20, the date of which is questionable, and which
may refer to the coronation in Hebron, it is clear from
incidental notices in the historical books of the Old Testament
that such consecration by a prophet or seer was felt to be a
necessary prelude to the usurpation of a throne. It was
thus that both Jehu and Hazael were incited to seize the
crowns of Samaria and Damascus.<a id='r436'></a><a href='#f436' class='c013'><sup>[436]</sup></a> The use of oil in religious
ritual went back to the days when Babylonian culture was
predominant in Western Asia, and the religious texts of
Babylonia contain many references to it. That the prophet
was anointed for his office, we know from the history of
Elisha.</p>

<p class='c003'>On the other hand, it is difficult to conceive that David’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>brother would have treated him with the contempt to which
he gave utterance in the valley of Elah (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='seventeen'>xvii.</abbr> 28) had
he really been a witness to his consecration as king, and
David’s future friendship with Jonathan, the heir-apparent to
the throne, would have been more than hypocritical. Possibly
the period of the consecration has been transferred from a
time when David had become the son-in-law of Saul and the
friend and guest of Samuel (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='nineteen'>xix.</abbr> 18-22) to an earlier
time in David’s life to which it is inappropriate.<a id='r437'></a><a href='#f437' class='c013'><sup>[437]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Abner, the cousin of Saul, remained the commander-in-chief
of the Israelitish army, the Turtannu or Tartan, as the
Assyrians would have called him. David, however, was made
a general—‘the captain of a thousand’ was the exact title.
The desultory war with the Philistines still continued, and
the new general soon justified his appointment. But his
successes and his popularity with the army aroused the
jealousy of the king. Saul began to plot against his life and
to hope that he might fall in one of the skirmishes with the
enemy. Merab, Saul’s elder daughter, had been promised to
him in marriage, but she was given to another, and though
her younger sister Michal was offered in her place, Saul
stipulated that David should bring him instead of a dowry a
hundred foreskins of the Philistines. It was the Egyptian
mode of counting the slain, which is still practised in
Abyssinia; when Meneptah <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> defeated the Libyans and
their northern allies, the number of the enemy who had fallen
was determined partly by the hands, partly by the foreskins
cut off from the slain. The hundred foreskins demanded
by Saul were doubled by David, who thereupon received
Michal as his wife.</p>

<p class='c003'>Saul had already, in one of his fits of frenzy, made an
attempt on David’s life. The day before he had heard the
women welcoming David as he returned from ‘the slaughter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>of the Philistine’<a id='r438'></a><a href='#f438' class='c013'><sup>[438]</sup></a> with sounds of music and the refrain:
‘Saul hath slain his thousands and David his ten thousands.’
The king brooded over the words, until in his moments of
insanity they overpowered all prudence and restraint. When
he recovered they still sounded in his ears, and his feigned
friendship towards his son-in-law concealed murder in his
heart.</p>

<p class='c003'>At last he openly avowed his desire to be rid of his
supposed enemy; and though in his saner hours he still
shrank from murdering him with his own hand, he suggested
both to Jonathan and to his retainers that they should do so.
David, in truth, was becoming a formidable rival. He was
idolised by the army, was popular among the people, and was
a member by marriage of the royal house. He was, moreover,
a Jew; and the tribe of Judah was now beginning to
rise into importance and to realise its own strength. Above
all, Samuel and the priests were at bitter feud with Saul, and
favourably disposed to David.</p>

<p class='c003'>Jonathan betrayed his father’s secret to his unsuspecting
friend, and bade him await the issue of an appeal to the better
nature of Saul. The appeal was successful, and for a time
Saul laid aside his suspicions and there was apparent, if not
real, harmony once more between him and his son-in-law.
But another success against the Philistines revived the evil
passions of the king. Again the old depression and gloom
came upon him, and David’s harp, instead of dissipating it,
transformed it into madness. Suddenly he flung his spear at
the player, who slipped aside and fled. The time for mediation
and forgiveness was passed. David could no longer be
safe in the presence of a madman who was bent on taking
his life. Royal guards were even sent to watch David’s
house, and he escaped only with the help of his wife. In
the night she let him down through the window of his room,
and laid on the bed in his place the image of the household
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>god covered with a sheet. When the king’s guards arrived
to take him she pretended that he was sick, and it was not
until they had come a second time that they discovered they
had been deceived. Saul reproached his daughter for abetting
her husband’s escape; but it was too late, and David had
made his way to the house of Samuel at Ramah. Here,
however, he was not yet safe from pursuit, and he and the
seer accordingly took refuge in the sacred enclosure of the
Naioth or monastery. There, surrounded by the prophet-dervishes,
they felt that even the king in the madness of
disappointed fury would not venture to violate their sanctuary.</p>

<p class='c003'>That Samuel also should have been compelled to shelter
himself from Saul’s anger, and that David on escaping from
Gibeah should at once have gone to him, makes it evident that
the king at least believed in the complicity of the seer in the
plot against his throne. It also raises the presumption that
Saul’s belief was justified, and that Samuel had played the
same part towards David that Ahijah subsequently played
towards Jeroboam, and Elijah towards Jehu. That David and
Samuel were acquainted with one another seems clear; indeed,
Gibeah and Ramah were so close to each other that it would
have been strange if the politic David had not visited the old
seer. Had it been on the occasion of one of these visits that
the rising rival of Saul was anointed with the consecrated oil?</p>

<p class='c003'>David remained safe in sanctuary. The messengers sent by
Saul to fetch him from it fell under the influence of the place,
and joined the dervishes in their ecstatic exercises; and when
Saul himself followed them, he too was infected by the religious
excitement around him. One of the sources used by the
compiler of the books of Samuel ascribes to this occasion the
origin of the saying: ‘Is Saul also among the prophets?’<a id='r439'></a><a href='#f439' class='c013'><sup>[439]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>But as in the case of the introduction of David to Saul,
there is again a double account of his escape. The two
narratives are equally worthy of credit from a historical point
of view, yet it is difficult to reconcile them together. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>compiler has endeavoured to do so by supposing that David
‘fled’ from the monastery of Ramah to Jonathan after Saul’s
return to Gibeah. But this only makes the difficulty of
harmonising the two accounts the greater. If we accept them
both, the only way of reconciling them is to suppose that a
considerable interval of time elapsed between the events
recorded in them, that in the monastery of Ramah peace was
once more established between David and his father-in-law,
and that David consequently returned to his accustomed place
at court. In this case, the statement of the compiler that the
second narrative follows immediately upon the first would be
a mistaken inference.<a id='r440'></a><a href='#f440' class='c013'><sup>[440]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>According to the second account, David came to Jonathan
and assured him that Saul was determined to take away his
life. Jonathan protested that this was impossible, although he
had himself previously warned his friend that such was the
case,<a id='r441'></a><a href='#f441' class='c013'><sup>[441]</sup></a> on the ground that his father concealed nothing from
him. It was then agreed that Jonathan should discover Saul’s
intentions and reveal them three days later to David, who
should meanwhile hide himself in the fields. Jonathan was
to shoot three arrows, and send a boy to gather them up. If
he told the boy they were on the hither side of David’s hiding-place,
it meant that all was well; if, on the contrary, he said
they were beyond it, David would know that his life was in
danger. The day following was the feast of the New Moon,
when David ought to have dined with the king. But his place
was empty; only Abner sat by the side of Saul, whose seat
was, as usual, ‘by the wall.’ Saul said nothing, thinking that
David was absent for ceremonial reasons; but when on the
next day the place was again empty, he asked Jonathan what
had become of him. Jonathan replied, as had been agreed
upon, that he had given David permission to go to Beth-lehem
to take part in an annual sacrifice of the family. But the
answer did not deceive his father. Saul broke forth into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>reproaches, accusing Jonathan of rebellion and folly in
preferring friendship to self-interest, and in saving the life of
one who would use it to deprive him of the crown. Jonathan
replied; and the king, mad with rage, flung his spear at his own
son, who left the table and made his way to the place where
David was concealed. There he gave the signal by which
David knew that he must flee for his life, and while the lad
was picking up the arrows the two friends embraced and
parted, perhaps for the last time.</p>

<p class='c003'>David fled to Nob. The priests of Shiloh had settled in it,
and he believed therefore that he would find a shelter there.
But Ahimelech was afraid of Saul; he knew that the king bore
no goodwill to his son-in-law, and it was strange that David
should be alone. David, however, had a ready answer to the
question why ‘no man’ was with him. Saul had sent him out
in haste on a secret mission, and his servants accordingly had
been ordered to wait for him ahead. The haste indeed was
such that he had brought with him neither food nor weapons.
The priest had only the shewbread to offer, and at first
hesitated about giving it to those who were not Levites. But
David overcame his scruples, assuring him that his companions
had ‘kept themselves from women’ for the past three days,
and that the vessels they carried with them were clean. At
the same time he took Goliath’s sword which had been
dedicated to Yahveh, and lay behind the ephod wrapped in a
cloth. Then he continued his flight, and did not rest until he
found himself at the court of the old enemy of Israel, Achish
the son of Maoch, king of Gath.<a id='r442'></a><a href='#f442' class='c013'><sup>[442]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Recent criticism has maintained that this first visit to Achish
of Gath is but a duplicate version of David’s second visit to
the same prince, like the duplicate accounts of his introduction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>to Saul and flight from the Israelitish court. The two visits,
however, clearly belong to different periods of time, and the
different treatment experienced by the fugitive at the hands of
the king of Gath was due to the wholly different circumstances
under which he arrived there on the two occasions. The
solitary and defenceless exile, flying for his life from his own
countrymen, was a very different person from the leader of a
numerous band of reckless and well-armed adventurers who
came to offer their services as mercenaries in war. A more
serious difficulty is the fact that Achish, the son of Maoch or
Maachah, was still reigning over Gath in the third year of
Solomon (1 Kings <abbr title='two'>ii.</abbr> 39). But the long reign of about fifty
years, which this presupposes, is no impossibility; Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr>
of Egypt, for example, was sixty-seven years on the throne.</p>

<p class='c003'>David did not remain long in Gath. The Philistines could
not forget that he had been one of their most formidable
adversaries, and there must have been some among them who
had blood-feuds to avenge upon him. The fugitive servant of
Saul was no longer to be feared, but there were many voices
crying for his life. For a while Achish was inclined to protect
him in the hope of using him against his countrymen, but how
long this protection would last was doubtful. David accordingly
feigned himself mad, he scrabbled on the gates, and let
the spittle fall on his unshorn beard. The Philistine king gave
up all hope of making him his tool, and allowed him to quit
the court. David thereupon made his way to the home of his
boyhood, and took refuge in the limestone caves of Adullam,
a few miles to the south-west of Beth-lehem.</p>

<p class='c003'>Here at last he was safe. He was among his own tribesmen,
in a district well known to him, and in a place of refuge
where the outlaw could defy his pursuers. Moreover, the
home of his family was not far distant, and it was not long,
accordingly, before his brothers and other relatives joined him
in his mountain stronghold. The band of outlaws increased
rapidly, and soon amounted to four hundred men. David’s
abilities as a military leader were known throughout Israel, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>all the outlaws and adventurers of Judah flocked to his
standard; among them was the prophet Gad.</p>

<p class='c003'>David once more found himself at the head of a considerable
force. The quarrel between him and the king was assuming
the character of a civil war. It was Judah against Israel, the
first revolt of the new power that was rising in the south against
the domination of the north. But the power was still in its
infancy. Against the trained veterans of the royal army, with
the prestige of legal authority and resources behind them, the
bandits of the Judæan mountains could hold their own only so
long as they remained among the limestone fastnesses of their
own land. It was like a struggle between Sicilian brigands
and the regular troops; the sympathies of the peasantry were
with the brigands, and as long as they acted on the defensive,
their lives were safe.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the mountains of Judah were barren, and it was needful
for David and his men to descend at times into the valleys
and plains below, and there levy contributions of food. These
were the moments of danger. The townsmen and owners of
land could not be trusted like the peasantry; they looked with
no favourable eyes on the armed outlaws who seized what was
not freely given to them, and were ready enough to betray
them to Saul. In the towns and plains the king’s troops had
the advantage; while, on the other side, it was always possible
to fall in with a body of Philistines to whom every Israelite
was a foe.</p>

<p class='c003'>But while David was hidden in the cave of Adullam, Saul
committed a deed which shattered his kingdom and transferred
the allegiance of the priesthood to his Judæan rival. This was
the massacre of the priests at Nob. In reading the story of it
we seem to have before us the words of an eye-witness. Saul
was seated under the tamarisk on the hill at Gibeah, with his
spear in his right hand, and his officers standing around him.
Suddenly he broke out into reproaches against them and
against his son. ‘Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of
Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds; that
all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that
sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of
Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth
unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to
lie in wait, as at this day?’ Then the heathen foreigner,
‘Doeg the Edomite which was set over the servants of Saul,’
answered and said that he had seen David come to Ahimelech
the priest at Nob, and that there the priest had consulted
Yahveh for him, had given him food and Goliath’s sword. At
once the infuriated king sent for Ahimelech and his brother
priests, and demanded of him why he had conspired with the
rebel. Ahimelech’s answer only increased his anger. David,
said the priest, was the son-in-law of the king, and his most
faithful servant; how then could he have refrained from
helping him on his road? Thereupon, Saul ordered the priests
to be put to death, but no Israelite could be found to
perpetrate such an act of sacrilegious atrocity. The Edomite,
however, had no scruples; he fell with a will upon the defenceless
priests, and eighty-five of them were massacred. Saul
then descended upon Nob, ‘the city of the priests,’ and treated
it like a city of the Amalekites, smiting it with the edge of the
sword, ‘both men and women, children and sucklings, and
oxen and asses and sheep.’ Only Abiathar, the son of
Ahimelech, escaped, and fled to David, carrying with him the
ephod and the oracles of God. The prophecy of the destruction
of Eli’s house was fulfilled, but in fulfilling it Saul
destroyed his own. The breach between the king and the
priests was complete; he had compelled them, and all who
reverenced them, to take the side of his rival.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was now that David determined to send his father and
mother to the protection of the Moabite court. His great-grandmother
had been a Moabitess, and it is possible that the
war between Saul and Moab, referred to in 1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 47,
was continuing at this very time. In this case, the Moabite
king would have given a ready welcome to the parents of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>enemy’s enemy. They would be hostages for David himself,
and David was a person whom it was desirable to attach to
the Moabite cause. Not only was he the son-in-law of Saul,
and an able general, but he was now at the head of a devoted
body of men who were waging war on the Israelitish king. If
war was actually going on at the time between Israel and
Moab, alliance with David would divert and weaken the
Israelitish attack. Moreover, as long as David’s parents were
in his power, the king of Moab could compel the Jewish
chieftain to serve and, if need be, to fight for him.</p>

<p class='c003'>David’s followers had increased to six hundred men, and he
now felt himself strong enough to occupy one of the Judæan
cities, and make it a centre for his war against Saul. A pretext
for doing so was soon found. Keilah was threatened by
Philistine raiders, and patriotism demanded its rescue. The
city is mentioned in the Tel el-Amarna letters under the name
of Keltê; it was already a place of military importance, and
was surrounded by walls. David’s followers, however, were
reluctant to leave their retreat in the mountains and venture
into a town. But the representative of the high priests of
Shiloh was now with them, and the oracles of Yahveh, which
he consulted through the ephod, admitted of no contradiction.
Keilah was accordingly occupied by David, and its Philistine
invaders repulsed. The citizens, however, showed little gratitude
towards their preservers. Perhaps they thought it was
merely an exchange of masters, and that Philistine pillage
would not have been worse than the exactions of the outlaws.
Perhaps they feared the fate of Nob for harbouring the enemy
of Saul. However it might be, they sent word to Saul that
David and his men were in the town. The king marched to
Keilah without delay; had not God delivered David into his
hand by bringing him into a city that had ‘gates and bars’?
But once more the ephod was consulted, and the answer was
clear. The people of Keilah were traitors, and David’s band
must seek a shelter elsewhere. This time they fled to the
wooded slopes above the wilderness of Ziph, on the eastern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>side of the Dead Sea. Here David and Jonathan met once
more<a id='r443'></a><a href='#f443' class='c013'><sup>[443]</sup></a> under the shadow of the forest. But the Ziphites
betrayed the hiding-place of the outlaws, and offered to help
the king to capture his foe. For a time the hunted fugitives
evaded their pursuers; spies brought David intelligence of
Saul’s movements, and the desolate wadis of Ziph and Maon,
with their deep defiles and precipitous rocks, enabled him to
slip out of the toils. But at last the game became desperate;
the outlaws were encircled on all sides, and the difficulty of
procuring food must have been great. At that moment the
Philistines came to their help; a messenger arrived in haste
at the royal camp, urging the king to march westward at once,
for a Philistine army had invaded the land. David was saved,
and he now settled himself in the caves and fastnesses of the
mountains about En-gedi.</p>

<p class='c003'>From the peaks where only the wild goats trod,<a id='r444'></a><a href='#f444' class='c013'><sup>[444]</sup></a> David
could look across the Dead Sea to the purple hills of Moab.
Here, therefore, he was in touch with the Moabites, while his
inaccessible position rendered him safe from attack. Below
him was the comparatively fertile valley of Carmel of Judah,
where large flocks of sheep fed on the scanty grass. It was
the northern portion of the wilderness of Paran, and the outlaws
exacted from it their supplies of food. The supplies
were usually yielded with a good grace, and in return the
shepherds and their flocks were protected from the Bedâwin
and the wild beasts. But on one occasion the request for
food met with a refusal. Nabal, a wealthy farmer at Maon,
was shearing his sheep, and refused to give any of them to the
messengers of David. Perhaps Saul was still in the neighbourhood,
and he was thus emboldened to play the part of
the churl. But he was soon taught that David was strong
enough to take without asking. Four hundred of the outlaws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>marched down upon Maon, bent upon making him and his
family pay with their lives for the niggardly refusal. The tact
of a woman, however, saved them, and averted the anger of
David. Abigail, the wife of Nabal, met the angry chieftain
on the road with presents and honeyed words, and her fair
looks and speeches induced him to turn back. That night
Nabal was holding a shearing feast in fancied security, but
when, the next day, his wife told him of his narrow escape,
and of the band of outlaws that was still in the neighbourhood,
his heart failed him, and ‘he became as a stone.’ The shock
was too great for his strength; a few days later he died. Then
Abigail, like a prudent woman, became the wife of the outlaw,
and the wealth of Nabal passed into his hands. It was a
welcome addition to David’s resources, and made him better
able to control his men. Abigail, too, proved a devoted wife,
following her husband in his wanderings, and sharing his wild
life. She was not his only wife, however, though Michal had
been given by her father to a Benjamite named Phaltiel.
David, it would seem, had already married a certain Ahinoam
of Jezreel.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was probably before the marriage of Abigail, and while
Saul was still chasing the outlaws through the wilderness of
Ziph,<a id='r445'></a><a href='#f445' class='c013'><sup>[445]</sup></a> that an incident occurred, two versions of which had
reached the compiler of the books of Samuel. Saul had with
him a force of three thousand men, more than sufficient
gradually to close in upon David and cut off all his chances of
escape. Abner, the commander-in-chief, was with him, and
the king was obstinate in his determination to track his enemy
to the death. According to the one version of the story, Saul
was alone in a cave; according to the other, he was asleep at
night in his camp among the rocky crevices of Mount Hachilah.
While he slept, David, with his two companions, Ahimelech
the Hittite and Abishai the brother of Joab, crept stealthily
towards him, and soon reached the unconscious king. Abishai
would have slain him with his spear, but David forbade his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>touching ‘the Lord’s anointed,’ and contented himself with
carrying away the spear and cruse of water which stood at his
head, or, according to the other version, with cutting off the
skirt of the royal robe. Then, standing on the opposite side
of the gorge, David reproached Abner for his careless watch
over the king. Saul recognised David’s voice, and demanded if
it were not he, whereupon David made an appeal to the king’s
better nature, asked why he was thus driving him from his
country and his God, and pointed to the trophies he had just
carried off in proof of his innocence. If he were really aiming
at the throne, would he have spared the king when Yahveh
had delivered him into his hands? The impulsive Saul
yielded for the moment to the voice and words of his former
favourite, but they produced no further effect upon him.
David could not venture to send back the spear by one of his
own men; it had to be fetched by a servant of the king.
David had given Saul a lesson in generosity, but the only
result of it was that he had to return to his old hiding-place.
Saul remained resolutely bent on taking his life.</p>

<p class='c003'>Meanwhile Samuel had died, and there seemed no longer
any power left in Israel to contend against the will of the king.
David began to perceive that his cause was hopeless; he had
become a mere chief of brigands, and against him were
arrayed all the forces of order and authority in the country.
It was useless to continue the struggle, and he determined,
therefore, to sell the services of himself and his followers to
the hereditary enemies of his people. Accordingly he passed
over to Achish of Gath, and entered the service of the
Philistine.</p>

<p class='c003'>The use of mercenary soldiers was no new thing. Egypt
had long since set the example, and in the age of the nineteenth
dynasty the larger part of the Egyptian army already
consisted of foreigners. Many of these were kinsfolk of the
Philistines from the Greek seas. Such soldiers of fortune
were acceptable to the kings who employed them for more
reasons than one. Their lives were devoted to fighting, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>therefore they were better trained and more amenable to
discipline than the native recruits, who were levied only as
occasion required. Moreover, they had everything to gain
and nothing to lose from war, unlike the peasantry, whose
fields might be ravaged while they themselves were away in
the camp. Above all, the mercenaries were faithful to their
employer so long as he supplied them with plunder or pay.
They had no party feuds to avenge, no loss of liberty to chafe
at, no spirit of independence to cherish. Their swords were
at the disposal of the king, and of none else; the tyranny
which crushed his subjects found in them a willing instrument.
David never forgot the lesson which his service with Achish
had taught him. When at last he became the king of Israel,
he also surrounded himself with a bodyguard of foreign mercenaries,
drawn from much the same countries as those of the
Pharaoh.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was not as a bodyguard, however, that Achish needed
the Jews. It was rather as an auxiliary force in future contests
with their countrymen. Consequently they were allowed
to settle in the country, at some distance from Gath, and
Ziklag was given them as a residence. The outlaws had ceased
to be brigands, and had become part of the regular army of a
foreign prince.</p>

<p class='c003'>For a year and four months the Hebrew corps dwelt at
Ziklag. But they were not idle all the time. Once David
led them on a raiding expedition against the Bedâwin Amalekites
of the south. Men, women, and children were alike put
to the sword, so that none might live to tell the tale. When
the Jews returned with their booty, David professed to Achish
that the raid had been directed against the Hebrews of Judah
and their allies the Kenites and Jerahmeelites. The deception
was successful, and the Philistine king rejoiced in the
thought that the captain of his mercenaries had thus for ever
rendered himself hateful to his countrymen. David had succeeded
in disarming the suspicions of his hosts, in providing
his retainers with the spoil they coveted, and yet at the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>time in not alienating from himself the affections of his own
people.</p>

<p class='c003'>But a further trial was in store for the wily exile. The
quarrel between Saul and his son-in-law had allowed the
Philistines to assert once more their old supremacy in Israel.
In David the Israelites had lost one of their chiefest generals,
and the troops which should have been employed against the
common foe were occupied in hunting him through the wilds
of the Judæan mountains. The watchful enemy took speedy
advantage of the fact. Israel was again invaded; the Philistines
swept the lowlands of Judah, and prepared to march
northward. Saul returned from his pursuit of David among
the trackless rocks on the shore of the Dead Sea only just in
time to prevent their penetrating again into the heart of Mount
Ephraim. The territory of Benjamin was saved for a time,
and the foreigner did not succeed in reaching the royal residence
at Gibeah.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the respite was not for long. A year and a quarter
later the united forces of the Philistine cities marched northward,
along the highroad on the coast of the Mediterranean,
which had been trodden so often by the former conquerors of
Western Asia. They passed Dor, the modern Tantûra, then
occupied by their kinsfolk the Zakkal, and, turning the point
of Mount Carmel, proceeded eastward through the valley of
the Kishon towards the plain of Megiddo. It was the old
fighting ground of Palestine; its possession gave the conqueror
the command of the whole country west of the Jordan, and
cut off the Israelitish king in his rear. With the enemy established
at Megiddo, Benjamin and Ephraim would be effectually
severed from the northern tribes.</p>

<p class='c003'>Saul lost no time in proceeding against his foe. The
Philistine camp had been pitched, first at Shunem, then at
Aphek, on the southern slope of Mount Gilboa;<a id='r446'></a><a href='#f446' class='c013'><sup>[446]</sup></a> the Israelites
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>now took up their station at a fountain near Jezreel, a few
miles to the north-west. But the sight of the huge Philistine
army, recruited, doubtless, as it had been by the Zakkal, filled
Saul with despair. His own forces were miserably insufficient
to meet it; he had lost his old confidence in Yahveh and
himself, and the priests and prophets had become his enemies.
In vain he sought counsel of Yahveh; such priests as still
remained near him refused their help, and ‘Yahveh answered
him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.’
Abiathar and Gad were with David; the prophets who had
gathered round Samuel were now the bitter foes of the
Israelitish king.</p>

<p class='c003'>In his despair he turned to the powers of witchcraft and
necromancy. In younger and happier days, before the
massacre at Nob, when he was still the favourite of the servants
of Yahveh, still enthusiastic for the religion of Israel,
Saul had driven from his dominions all those who professed
to traffic with the powers of the unseen world. The wizards
and fortune-tellers, the enchanters and the possessed had
been expelled from the land. The fact is a proof of the influence
of the Mosaic code and religion in the priestly and royal
circle.<a id='r447'></a><a href='#f447' class='c013'><sup>[447]</sup></a> Elsewhere in Western Asia the necromancers’ trade
was flourishing; Babylonia, which was the home of the culture
of Western Asia, was the home also of the arts of magic.
Here the magician was held in high honour, and the literature
of magic and omens occupied a large place in the libraries of
the country. We cannot suppose that beliefs which were held
by the most cultivated classes of Babylonia were not also
shared by the mass of the population in Canaan and Israel.
And it must be remembered that outside the Levitical law
there was no suspicion or idea that those who practised magic
had dealings with spirits of evil. Heathendom drew no
distinction between spirits of good and spirits of evil; the gods
themselves were destructive as well as beneficent. The Mosaic
condemnation of witchcraft was utterly opposed to the popular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>belief, and Saul’s expulsion of those who practised it proves
not only the existence of the Law, but also its recognition as
the law of the state by the representatives of the religion of
Yahveh. It was a reform analogous to those of Hezekiah and
of Isaiah in later days; an attempt to conform to the Law of
Yahveh, contrary though it was to the prejudices and the practices
of the time.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the king was now forsaken by the Law and its ministers,
and as a last resource he turned to the forbidden arts. In
disguise he went by night to a witch at Endor, and begged her
to raise the shade of Samuel from the dead. And Samuel
came in visible presence to the witch, though his voice only
was heard by the king. But it was a voice that pronounced
judgment. God had indeed departed from Saul and given his
kingdom to another, and the doom was about to be fulfilled.
Before the morrow’s sun was set, where Samuel was there
should Saul and his sons be also, and the host of Israel should
be delivered into the hand of the Philistines. Saul fell to the
earth in a swoon; he had fasted all the previous day, and
brain and body were alike worn out.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was an ill-omened beginning for the day of battle which
followed. Like the army of Israel, that of the Philistines
was divided into companies of a thousand men each, which
were further subdivided into companies of a hundred. Along
with the native Philistines and their allies, the band of
Hebrew mercenaries marched past the five generals. But
hardly had they passed when a discussion arose as to their
trustworthiness. Achish, indeed, declared his full confidence
in the fidelity of David and his followers, but the other
Philistine ‘lords’ distrusted them. The risk of employing
them against their own countrymen was too great. How
could they be trusted not to desert at a critical moment of the
battle, and so make their peace with Saul by the sacrifice of
the uncircumcised foreigner? The wishes of Achish were
overruled, and David was sent back to Ziklag.</p>

<p class='c003'>What would David have done had the result of the council
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>been otherwise? It has generally been assumed that the fears
of the Philistine lords were justified, and that he would have
betrayed his new masters by going over to his old one. But
in that case it is probable that he would have found some
excuse for not leaving Ziklag and accompanying Achish on
his march. That he followed the Philistine army as far as the
field of battle implies that in selling his services to the king
of Gath, he accepted all the recognised consequences of the
act. As he had told Saul, it was not only from his country
that he was driven out, but from the God of his country as
well. In leaving Judah for Gath he had transferred his
duties from Israel to Philistia, from Saul to Achish, from
Yahveh to Dagon. It was the first step that mattered: all
else was contained in it. The duties of the mercenary were
well understood: he ceased to have a country of his own, and
became, as it were, the property of the prince to whom his
services were given. In after days, David would have had no
scruple in employing his Philistine bodyguard in subjugating
their kinsmen, any more than the Egyptians had in employing
their Sardinian or Libyan mercenaries in their wars against
Libya and the peoples of the Greek seas.</p>

<p class='c003'>David, indeed, would not have lifted up his hand personally
to attack ‘the anointed of Yahveh.’ But there was a good deal
of difference between a hand-to-hand fight between himself and
Saul and assisting his new masters in overthrowing the power
of the northern tribes of Israel. Between the Jews and these
northern tribes there was always a certain amount of smothered
hostility, which broke out into actual war in the early part of
David’s reign, and eventually led to the revolt of the Ten
Tribes. It was not the Israelitish king, but the Israelitish
kingdom which David and his followers were helping to
destroy.</p>

<p class='c003'>We need not question his sincerity, therefore, when he
offered his sword to the lords of the Philistines and protested
against their mistrust of himself. Nor would the fact that he
had been on the side of the Philistine enemy have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>prejudicial to his future interests, if he already cherished the
hope of being the successor of Saul. It was in Judah, among
his own tribesmen, and not in Northern Israel, that the
foundations of his kingdom were to be laid; it was only the
Jews, consequently, whose good-will it was needful for him to
secure. If he already aimed at extending his power over all
Israel, a defeated and broken Israel would be more easily
won over to him than an Israel proud of its independence
and strength, and attached to the house of a sovereign who
had led them to victory.<a id='r448'></a><a href='#f448' class='c013'><sup>[448]</sup></a> David’s loyalty to Achish, however,
was never put to the test. He and his mercenaries were
sent back to Ziklag, and their dismissal from the field of
battle was in itself an insult which would serve as a pretext
for a quarrel with the Philistines should the need or opportunity
for one ever arise. But when they reached their homes,
they found there only desolation and ruins. The Bedâwin
Amalekites had made a raid upon the undefended town, had
burned its buildings and carried away the women and the
spoil. There was no longer any Saul to repress their attacks,
or to exact vengeance for their incursions.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mutiny broke out among the mercenaries. They accused
David of having torn them from their families, thus leaving
Ziklag to the mercy of the foe. He was the cause of the
disaster, and they began to talk of stoning him to death.
The priest Abiathar came, however, to his rescue, and announced
through the ephod the word of Yahveh that the
robbers should be overtaken and the spoil recovered. At
once, therefore, the pursuit commenced. The Bedâwin tracks
were followed in such haste that when the desert was reached,
only four hundred out of the whole band of six hundred had
strength enough to proceed. Then an Egyptian was found
who had been a slave among the Amalekites, and having
fallen ill on their retreat from Palestine had been left to die
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>upon the road. The departure of the Philistine army had
exposed the Negeb to the attack of the Bedâwin, and they
had not been slow to take advantage of it.<a id='r449'></a><a href='#f449' class='c013'><sup>[449]</sup></a> Only three days
had elapsed since they had passed the spot where the slave
was found, and he offered himself a willing guide to the
Hebrews in their quest of his former masters. The Amalekite
tents were soon reached, and the nomads were found
feasting on the abundant plunder they had gained and dancing
in fancied security. Suddenly at twilight the Hebrews fell
upon them, and an indiscriminate slaughter took place. The
massacre went on for twenty-four hours, and none of the
Amalekites escaped except about four hundred young men,
who succeeded in mounting their camels and flying beyond
pursuit. All the spoil they had carried off fell into the hands
of their conquerors, including the two wives of David himself.
The flocks and herds were given to David: the rest of the
plunder was divided among his followers, the two hundred
men who had been left on the road being allowed, after some
dispute, to share it equally with their fellows.<a id='r450'></a><a href='#f450' class='c013'><sup>[450]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>David, with characteristic foresight, sent portions of the spoil
that had been allotted to him as a ‘present’ to ‘the elders of
Judah’ in the chief towns of the tribe. The Jerahmeelites
and Kenites were not forgotten, nor the Calebites of Hebron.
Some of the plunder was sent as far south as Hormah and
Zephath, as well as to Aroer and Ramoth of the south.
Reuben and Simeon had now ceased to exist as separate
tribes, Simeon having been absorbed into Judah while such
cities of Reuben as still remained Israelite had been occupied
by ‘the elders of Judah.’<a id='r451'></a><a href='#f451' class='c013'><sup>[451]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>David’s object in sending the presents was cloaked under
the pretext that they were made to those who had befriended
him in the days of his wandering. But the pretext was more
than transparent. His wanderings had never extended to
Hormah or Aroer, or even to ‘the cities of the Jerahmeelites.’
A crown was already within measurable distance of the
Jewish chieftain: his soldier’s eye had seen that the Israelitish
army was no match for that of the Philistines, and the priests
who were with him were assured that Yahveh had forsaken
Saul, and would work no miracle in his favour. The Philistines
were once more dominant in the south, and a victory at
Gilboa would make that domination secure. David possessed
the confidence of Achish, and as the vassal of the Philistines
he could count on their support were he to make himself the
king of Judah. All that was needed was the good-will of the
Jewish elders, and this his victory over the Amalekites gave
him the means of purchasing.</p>

<p class='c003'>On the other hand, were the Philistines to be defeated, and
the Hebrew army, contrary to all probability, to be victorious,
David’s position would be in nowise affected. He would
still be safe among the Philistines, out of reach of Saul, and
at the head of a formidable band of mercenary troops. The
pretext for sending the presents could be urged with some
show of reason: they were merely a return to the friends who
had aided him in the time of his necessity. Now, as ever,
David could indignantly disclaim any intention of plotting
against the ‘anointed of the Lord.’</p>

<p class='c003'>While David was thus looking after his own interests,
events were fighting for him in the north. The Israelites at
Gilboa were utterly defeated, and all Israel lay helpless at the
feet of the heathen. Saul was slain along with his three
elder sons; only a minor, Esh-Baal, was left, who was carried
for safety to the eastern side of the Jordan. Israel was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>without either a king or a leader; even its army was lost.
For a time the mercenaries of David were the only armed
force that still remained among the tribes of Israel.</p>

<p class='c003'>Saul had fallen on his own sword. Wounded by an arrow,
he had prayed his armour-bearer to slay him lest he should
fall still living into the hands of his foes. But his armour-bearer
refused to commit the act of sacrilege, and the king
slew himself. His body, like those of his sons, was stripped
and hung in derision from the walls of Beth-shan. But the
inhabitants of Jabesh of Gilead could not forget that Saul had
once saved them from the Ammonite, and they went by night
and carried away the ghastly trophies of Philistine victory;
the bodies were first burnt, then the ashes were buried under
a tree at Jabesh, and a fast of seven days was held for the
dead.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Philistines do not seem to have crossed the Jordan.
They contented themselves with occupying the country west
of it, and garrisoning the cities from which the Israelites had
fled. The monarchy had fallen, and the house of Israel
appeared to have fallen with it. From Dan to Beersheba the
Philistine was supreme.</p>

<p class='c003'>Deliverance came from the south, from the latest born of
the Israelitish tribes. The mixed Israelite, Edomite, and
Kenite population, which had there been slowly forming into
a united community, now found a common head and leader in
the son of Jesse. David, too, was of mixed descent. His
great-grandmother had been the Moabitess Ruth, and on his
father’s side he was partly of Calebite origin.<a id='r452'></a><a href='#f452' class='c013'><sup>[452]</sup></a> Mixed races
have always shown themselves the most vigorous and the most
fitted to rule, and the history of the Israelitish monarchy is no
exception to the general law. A purely Israelitish dynasty had
failed, as it was destined to do again after the revolt of the
Ten Tribes; it needed the genius and tact of the Jewish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>David to establish the monarchy on a lasting basis and defend
it against all enemies.</p>

<p class='c003'>The news of the death of the king of Israel was brought to
David by an Amalekite. He had robbed the corpse of its
crown and golden bracelets which he laid at the feet of the
Jewish chief. In the hope of a reward he had come in hot
haste and pretended that he had dealt the final blow which
delivered David from his enemy, and opened to him the way
to a throne.<a id='r453'></a><a href='#f453' class='c013'><sup>[453]</sup></a> But he met with an unexpected reception.
The story of the disaster aroused in David his slumbering
patriotism, his affection for Jonathan, and his old reverence
for Saul. Now that he had nothing any longer to fear from
the Hebrew king, and everything to gain by his death, he
could allow his impulse and emotions to have free play. He
turned in anger upon the messenger, demanding of him how
he—a stranger and an Amalekite—had dared to lift up his
hand against the anointed of Yahveh. Then he ordered his
followers to cut down the luckless Bedâwi, whose blood, as
he told him, was upon his own head. After their recent
experience the nomad thief was likely to have but a short
shrift at the hands of the mercenaries.</p>

<p class='c003'>In this act of vengeance there was that mixture of policy
and impulse which is the key to so many of David’s actions.
On the one hand, David freed himself from all responsibility
for the death of Saul. The blood of the king could not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>required at his hand either in the form of a blood-feud with
the family of Saul, or in that of the nemesis which waited on
the shedder of blood. On the other hand, it could not be
said that he had gained the crown through the murder of the
legitimate king. Saul indeed had been slain, and David had
reaped the advantage of his death, but he had in no way
connived at it. In the eyes of God and man alike he was
innocent of the deed.</p>

<p class='c003'>David found an outlet for his feelings in a dirge which is
one of the gems of early Hebrew poetry. Future generations
knew it as the Song of the Bow; such was the name under
which it was incorporated in the collection of early Hebrew
poems called the book of Jasher, and under which David
ordered that it should be learned in the schools.</p>

<p class='c015'>David, however, was too practical to spend his time in useless
laments. He had relieved his feelings in a burst of lyric
poetry; it was now time to seize the opportunity which the
overthrow and death of Saul had given him. The oracle of
Yahveh was consulted, and the answer was favourable; let
David march to Hebron and there offer himself as king of
Judah. The way had already been prepared: he had secured
the good-will of the Jewish elders; he was the son-in-law of
the late king, and a hero of whom his tribesmen were proud.
Above all, he had behind him a body of armed veterans and
devoted adherents, the only armed force now left in the
country.</p>

<p class='c003'>Hebron was the natural capital of Judah. It is true it had
been a Calebite settlement, but Calebites and Jews were now
one. Its ancient sanctuary had been a gathering-place for the
population of the south from time immemorial, and there was
no other city which could rival its claims to pre-eminence.
Here, therefore, the representatives of Judah assembled, and
here they anointed David to be their king. The goal of so
many years of struggle and hardship, of patient waiting and
politic tact, was at length reached. David was king of
Judah; it could not be long before he became king of Israel
also.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Philistines offered no difficulties. David was their
vassal; he had shown himself loyal to them, and they were
well content that he should rule over his countrymen, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>collect the tribute due from them year by year. The territory
of Judah, moreover, was small; it adjoined the cities of the
Philistines, and in case of revolt could easily be overrun and
reduced to subjection. That a rival prince should reign in
the north, thus separating the northern tribes from Judah and
putting an end to all joint action, was a further guarantee for
Philistine supremacy. The old Egyptian province of Canaan
had become Palestine, the land of the Philistines.</p>

<p class='c003'>For seven and a half years David reigned in Hebron.
Meanwhile, the relics of the Israelitish army had found a refuge
on the eastern side of the Jordan. Here, under their old
commander-in-chief Abner, the son of Ner, they once more
formed themselves into a disciplined body, and made Esh-Baal,
the surviving son of Saul, their king.<a id='r455'></a><a href='#f455' class='c013'><sup>[455]</sup></a> Esh-Baal, we are
told, reigned two years. His position was a difficult one.
His rule was titular only; all the real power of the State was
in the hands of his uncle Abner. Judah refused to acknowledge
his authority, and had raised itself into a separate kingdom
under a rebel chief; the northern tribes on the west side of the
Jordan were in subjection to the heathen conqueror who held
possession of the highroad from Asia into Egypt, and therewith
of the trade and wealth that passed along it. Cut off
from Mount Ephraim, the subjects of Esh-Baal saw David, the
Jewish vassal of the Philistines, extending his sway over
Benjamin, the ancestral territory of the house of Saul, while
they themselves maintained a precarious struggle against their
foes behind the fortified walls of Mahanaim. Here they
would have been under the protection of the Ammonites, who
were threatened by the same enemy as themselves.<a id='r456'></a><a href='#f456' class='c013'><sup>[456]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>The Philistines found the task of forcing the fords of the
Jordan too dangerous or too unprofitable. Terms were made
with the Israelites; Esh-Baal became their vassal, and his
nominal rule was allowed to extend over Western Israel as far
south as the frontiers of Judah. Here the two vassal kingdoms
came into collision with one another, and Israel and Judah
were engaged in perpetual war. It was a repetition of what
had been the state of Canaan in the closing days of the
Egyptian empire when the Tel el-Amarna letters passed to
and fro.</p>

<p class='c003'>Esh-Baal was merely the shadow of a king. Whether he
was a minor or an imbecile it is impossible to say with
certainty; most probably he was but a child.<a id='r457'></a><a href='#f457' class='c013'><sup>[457]</sup></a> Abner, the
master of the army, was also the real master of the kingdom.
David’s rise to power must have been as distasteful to him as
it would have been to Saul, and he seized the first opportunity
of endeavouring to overthrow it. The brigand-chief had become
a king, and the outlaws who had gathered round him in
the cave of Adullam had been rewarded with posts of honour.
Joab, the nephew of David,<a id='r458'></a><a href='#f458' class='c013'><sup>[458]</sup></a> was made the commander-in-chief
of the Jewish army, and the choice was justified by the
results. David owed most of his future successes in war to
the military skill and generalship of his commander-in-chief.
He himself ceased more and more to take part in active
warfare; Joab more than supplied his place, and the safety of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>the king was too important to the army and its general to
allow of his risking his person in battle. David ruled at
home while Joab gained victories for him in the field.</p>

<p class='c003'>Joab proved a faithful and a loyal servant. No suspicion
was ever breathed against him that he sought to steal the
hearts of his soldiers away from their master, and to supplant
David as David had supplanted Saul. In the evil days of
rebellion and disaster that were to overtake David, Joab
never deserted him, and his restoration to the throne was the
work of his faithful general. The services, however, rendered
by Joab had their drawback. He became indispensable to the
king; nay more, he became the master of the king. As
David grew old, he began to fret under the irksome yoke;
gratitude and self-interest alike forbade him to remove his too
powerful servant by those Oriental means which had given him
a wife, and up to the day of his death Joab’s power was
checked only by the influence or the intrigues of Bath-sheba.</p>

<p class='c003'>Even in the early days when David still reigned at Hebron,
there was ill-feeling between the uncle and the nephew. The
masterful nature of Joab had asserted itself, and David was
made to feel that his throne depended on ‘the sons of
Zeruiah.’ War had broken out between Esh-Baal and David.
The Jews, it would seem, had advanced northward into the
territory of Benjamin, where they were met at Gibeon by the
Israelite forces under Abner from Mahanaim. A fierce battle
ensued which ended in the defeat of the Israelite troops.
Abner fled across the Jordan, the north of Israel being in the
hands of the Philistines, and the authority of David was
acknowledged as far as Mount Ephraim. The Benjamites
were forced to transfer their allegiance from the house of Saul
to that of Jesse. Nineteen Jews only had fallen in the fight,
while 360 of the enemy were left dead on the field of battle.
But among the Jews was Asahel, the younger brother of Joab,
who had been slain by Abner during his flight. It was the
beginning of a blood-feud which could be extinguished only
by Abner’s death.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>Abner’s military genius was no match for that of Joab, and
the long war which followed between David and Esh-Baal saw
the power of the Jewish king steadily increase. David began
to assume the manners and privileges of an Oriental despot,
to multiply his wives, and to marry into the families of the
neighbouring kinglets. Four more wives were added to his
harîm, one of whom was the daughter of Talmai, the Aramaitish
king of Geshur. The alliance with Talmai had a political
object; Geshur lay on the northern frontier of Esh-Baal’s
kingdom, and in Esh-Baal, therefore, David and Talmai had a
common enemy.<a id='r459'></a><a href='#f459' class='c013'><sup>[459]</sup></a> Absalom was the offspring of the marriage
with the Aramaitish princess.<a id='r460'></a><a href='#f460' class='c013'><sup>[460]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Enclosed between Geshur and Judah, with Benjamin lost
and the north of Israel garrisoned by the Philistines, the
dynasty of Saul grew continually weaker. The Ammonites
made common cause with David (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='eleven'>xi.</abbr> 2), and in the
neighbouring Aramæans found further allies. Abner was not
slow in perceiving that his fortunes were linked with those of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>a lost cause, and he determined to betray his nephew and his
master. A pretext was quickly found; he entered the royal
harîm and spent a night with Rizpah, the concubine of Saul.
The act was equivalent to claiming the throne, and Esh-Baal
naturally ventured to protest. The protest gave Abner the
opportunity he wanted. He fell with angry words on the
helpless king, told him that his throne depended on his
general’s loyalty, and that that loyalty was at an end.
Henceforth Abner’s sword was at the service of David to
transfer to him the kingdom from the house of Saul, and
to establish the rule of the Jewish prince from Dan to
Beer-sheba.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Israelite general now sent secret messengers to David
to arrange the details of the betrayal. Abner undertook to
‘bring over’ all Israel to David, in return for which he was to
supplant Joab as the commander of David’s army. The terms
were agreed to by the Jewish king, David only stipulating in
addition that Michal should be restored to him. We are not
told what it was proposed to do with Esh-Baal; Abner’s
treason, however, involved putting him out of the way. As
long as he lived there would have been a claimant to the
Israelite throne.</p>

<p class='c003'>The plot prospered at first. Abner tampered successfully
with the elders of Israel, reminding them that they had once
wanted David as their king,<a id='r461'></a><a href='#f461' class='c013'><sup>[461]</sup></a> and that Yahveh had declared
that through him alone the yoke of the Philistines should be
broken. The Benjamites also allowed themselves to be
persuaded by one of their own princes, who was at the same
time the most prominent member of the house of Saul, and
Abner accordingly went to Hebron with a troop of twenty
men to announce to David that his part of the compact had
been fulfilled. But the secret had already oozed out. Abner
had timed his visit so that Joab should be absent on a raid
when he had his audience with David. Joab, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>returned sooner than was expected, and, pretending to be
ignorant of the real object of Abner’s coming, expostulated
with the king for allowing an enemy to penetrate to the court
and spy out the weak places of the land. Meanwhile he had
sent a messenger who brought Abner back to Hebron, where
he and his brother Abishai murdered the unsuspecting
Israelite, and thus avenged the blood of Asahel.</p>

<p class='c003'>The blow was felt keenly by David, who saw in it the
destruction of his hopes. The acquisition of Israel seemed
further off than ever, for the Israelites were not likely to
forgive or forget the murder of their chief. Worst of all,
perhaps, his chances of getting rid of Joab were at an end.
It was clear that the Jewish general had discovered the
treachery that had been meditated towards him, and though
he was too politic to reproach the king, it gave him a firmer
hold upon David than before. From the point of view of the
monarchy, indeed, this was fortunate, as Joab had proved
himself a better and more loyal general than Abner, and it is
probable that had Abner been thrust into his place, the future
conquests of David would never have been made.</p>

<p class='c003'>All that David could do was to disavow the murder of
Abner, to protest that though he had been anointed king
he had not the power to punish the perpetrators of it, and
ostentatiously to abstain from food at the public dinner of
the court. Abner, moreover, received a sumptuous burial in
Hebron, at which the king was chief mourner. Joab must
have recognised the policy of the king’s action, since he seems
to have accepted it without a word of protest. He had gained
his point; his rival was removed from his path, and his position
in the kingdom was more unquestioned than ever.</p>

<p class='c003'>The death of Abner reduced the adherents of Esh-Baal to
despair. The seeds of disaffection which he had sown also
began to grow up. If Israel was to be delivered from the
Philistines, it was evident that the throne of Esh-Baal must
be occupied by another. Time was on the side of David,
and it was not long before the end came.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>Esh-Baal was murdered by two of his own tribesmen.
Baanah and Rechab, the sons of Rimmon, penetrated into
his bed-chamber one summer afternoon while he was taking
his <i>siesta</i>, and there murdered the sleeping king. Then they
beheaded the corpse, and, taking the head with them, hurried
to David at Hebron without once resting on the road.<a id='r462'></a><a href='#f462' class='c013'><sup>[462]</sup></a> But
David was too prudent to countenance the deed. While
securing all the advantages of it, he ordered summary punishment
to be inflicted on its perpetrators, and thus cleared
himself and his house from the stain of blood. Like the
Amalekite who claimed to have killed Saul, the murderers of
Esh-Baal were put to death, and the divine law, which exacted
blood for blood, was satisfied. The Jewish king could enjoy
with an easy conscience the fruits of a murder of which he
was innocent. No other rival stood in his path, for Merib-Baal,
the son of Jonathan, was a hopeless cripple, with his
spine injured by a fall in his childhood. When he was still
but five years of age the fatal battle of Gilboa had taken
place, and his nurse in the hurry of flight had dropped the
child from her arms.<a id='r463'></a><a href='#f463' class='c013'><sup>[463]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The death of Esh-Baal made David king of what was left
of Northern Israel. Those who had gathered round the son
of Saul at Mahanaim now flocked to Hebron, and there
anointed the king of Judah king also of Israel. They
reminded him that they, too, were of his ‘bone and flesh,’
sprung from a common ancestor and acknowledging the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>God, that he had once been their leader against the Philistines,
and that it had been predicted of him that he should again be
the captain of Israel.<a id='r464'></a><a href='#f464' class='c013'><sup>[464]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>His coronation as king of Israel led to war with the
Philistines. From the vassal prince who reigned at Hebron,
and whose title was not acknowledged by the majority of his
countrymen, there was nothing to fear; it was different when
he had become the king of a united Israel, and could once
more summon the forces around him with which he had
gained the victories of his earlier years. In accepting the
crown of Israel, moreover, without the permission of the
Philistines, David had been guilty of revolt. The Philistines
claimed dominion over the whole of Northern Israel west of
the Jordan; if they had condoned his annexation of the
territory of Benjamin, it was because he was still their
tributary vassal, and the annexation meant war between him
and the rival kingdom of Israel. The heathen lords of Palestine
were well content that Judah and Israel should waste
their strength in contending with one another. But the union
of the two kingdoms turned that strength against themselves.
The union had been effected without their consent; it was
‘the men of Israel’ who had anointed David without consulting
the suzerain power.</p>

<p class='c003'>At first the war went against the newly crowned king. He
was taken by surprise, and the Philistine army had invaded
his territories before he had time to gather his forces together.
Beth-lehem, the seat of David’s forefathers, was seized by the
enemy, and made the base of their attack. Thus cut off
from help from the northern and eastern tribes, or even from
Benjamin, David was forced to retire from Hebron, and once
more to take refuge in the ‘hold’ of Adullam.<a id='r465'></a><a href='#f465' class='c013'><sup>[465]</sup></a> It was a
country well known to him; it had already saved him from
the pursuit of Saul, and the foreign foe did not dare to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>penetrate into its dark caves and narrow gorges. Here for a
time he carried on a guerilla warfare with the Philistines until
he felt himself strong enough to venture out into the open
field. It was while he was thus keeping the enemy at bay
that three of his followers performed a deed which placed
them among the thirty <span lang="hbo"><i>gibbôrîm</i></span>, or ‘mighty men,’ in immediate
attendance on the king.<a id='r466'></a><a href='#f466' class='c013'><sup>[466]</sup></a> David had a sudden longing
for the water of the well at the gate of Beth-lehem, of which
he had doubtless often drunk in his boyish days. His wish
was overheard by Joshebbasshebeth,<a id='r467'></a><a href='#f467' class='c013'><sup>[467]</sup></a> Eleazar, and Shammah,
who broke through the host of the Philistines, and succeeded
in bringing the water to their leader. David, however, refused
to drink it. It was, as it were, the price of blood; the three
heroes had risked their lives to bring it, and the king accordingly
poured it out as a libation to the Lord.</p>

<p class='c003'>How long this guerilla warfare lasted we do not know.
Only a meagre abstract is given us of the wars and conquests
of David, and it seems probable that a detailed history of
them has been intentionally omitted by the compiler of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>books of Samuel. A separate work dealing with the history
was doubtless in existence at the time he wrote, and there
was no room for another by the side of it. It was the lesser
known portion of David’s history which he aimed at compiling
out of the records of the past. The story, therefore, of the
conquest of the Philistines and then of the creation of an
Israelitish empire has been lost to us; we know the results,
but little more.</p>

<p class='c003'>When David at length ventured to descend from his
mountain fortress, the Philistines were encamped in the plain
of Rephaim, or the ‘Giants,’ which stretched to the south-east
of Jerusalem.<a id='r468'></a><a href='#f468' class='c013'><sup>[468]</sup></a> He was thus cut off from the north, the
road being further barred by the Jebusite stronghold of Jerusalem,
which appears to have peacefully submitted to the
Philistine domination. For a while the two hostile forces
watched one another, neither daring to attack the other.
Heroes and champions on either side performed individual
deeds of valour like that which had first won recognition for
David on the part of Saul, but no general engagement took
place.<a id='r469'></a><a href='#f469' class='c013'><sup>[469]</sup></a> The Philistines were too numerous, the Israelites too
securely posted to be assailed.</p>

<p class='c003'>At last, however, David judged that his opportunity had
come. The oracle of Yahveh was consulted; the answer was
favourable; and the Israelites descended suddenly on their
enemies at a place called Baal-perazim. The Philistines fled
precipitately, leaving behind them the images of their gods,
which fell into the hands of the conquering army. The
defeat at Gilboa was in part avenged.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the strength of the Philistines was by no means broken,
and they still held possession of the country north of Judah.
Once more they poured through the valley of Rephaim, and
once more they were driven back towards the coast. David
had fallen upon them in the rear, the sound of the approaching
footsteps of the Israelites being drowned in the rustling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>made by the wind in a grove of mulberry-trees. This time
the invaders were utterly shattered; they retreated from the
territory of Benjamin, and fled to Gezer, which was still in
Canaanite hands. The war was now carried into the country
of the enemy. Gath, the most inland of the Philistine cities,
was the primary object of attack; but a long and desultory
war was needed before either it or its sister cities could be
forced to yield. Again opportunities occurred for the display
of individual deeds of prowess, and for winning the rewards
of valour from the Israelitish king. The three brothers of
Goliath were slain by three of the champions of Israel,
Jonathan the nephew of David being the victor in one
combat, Abishai the brother of Joab in another. Abishai’s
victory was gained at Gob, where David narrowly escaped
death at the hands of the giant Ishbi-benob.<a id='r470'></a><a href='#f470' class='c013'><sup>[470]</sup></a> The narrowness
of the escape terrified his subjects, and they determined
that he should not again expose his life in the field. The
memory of Saul’s death and its disastrous results was too
recent to be forgotten. Henceforward, except on rare occasions,
David governed his people from the city or the palace;
his armies were led by Joab, and the king became to them
a name rather than an inspiring presence. The personal
affection he had once excited was confined to his bodyguard,
and when the evil days of rebellion came upon him, it was
the bodyguard alone which remained faithful to their king.</p>

<p class='c003'>Before the war with the Philistines was finished, an event
occurred which had a momentous influence on the future
history of Judah. This was the capture of Jerusalem. The
Jebusite city had severed Judah from the northern tribes,
and the struggle with the Philistines had shown what advantage
that gave to an enemy. A united Israel was impossible
so long as the Israelitish territory was thus cut in two by a
belt of hostile country. While Jerusalem remained in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>hands of the foreigner, Israel could never be secure from
Philistine attacks, or its king be able to hurl against the
enemy the full force of his dominions. If the Philistine war
was to be brought to a decisive and satisfactory end, if the
king of Judah was also to be king of Israel, it was needful
that Jerusalem should be his. We have learned from the
tablets of Tel el-Amarna how important Jerusalem already
was in the days when the Israelites had not as yet quitted
Egypt, and when Canaan formed part of the Egyptian empire.
Its position made it one of the strongest of Canaanitish
fortresses. It was the capital of a larger territory than usually
belonged to the cities of Canaan, and it was already venerable
for its antiquity. Its ruler was also a priest, ‘without father
and without mother,’ and appointed to his office by ‘the
Mighty King,’ ‘the Most High God’ of the book of Genesis.
Its name testified to the worship of a god of peace: Urusalim,
as it is written in the cuneiform characters, signified
‘the City of Salim,’ the god of peace.</p>

<p class='c003'>The city stood on a hill to which in after days was given
the name of Moriah. A low depression, first recognised in
our own days by Dr. Guthe, separated it from another hill,
which sloped southward till it ended in a point. On one side
was the deep limestone valley through which the torrent of
the Kidron had forced its way; on the other side, to the
west, was another valley known in later times as that of the
sons of Hinnom. On the southern hill was a fort which
protected the approach to the upper town to the north.<a id='r471'></a><a href='#f471' class='c013'><sup>[471]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Its Jebusite defenders believed it to be impregnable. Even
the lame and the blind, they said, could repel the assault of
an enemy. But they were soon undeceived. The Israelites
climbed up the cliff through a drain or aqueduct that had
been cut in the rock, and the Jebusite fortress was taken. It
may be that its capture was due to treachery, and that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>way had been shown to the besiegers by one of the garrison;
at all events the inhabitants of the city were spared, and
henceforward shared it with settlers from Judah and Benjamin.
The latter would seem to have been chiefly planted in the
new city which David built on the southern hill of Zion
where the Jebusite fortress had stood. In contradistinction
to Jerusalem it came to be known as the City of David; a
strong wall of fortification was built around it, a Millo or
citadel was erected on the site of the Jebusite fort, and the
king’s palace was founded in its midst. The palace seems
to have stood on the western side of the hill, with a flight of
steps cut in the rock leading down from it to the valley
below, traces of which have apparently been discovered by
Dr. Bliss in his recent excavations.<a id='r472'></a><a href='#f472' class='c013'><sup>[472]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>It was built by Phœnician artificers from Tyre. War and
foreign oppression had destroyed most of the culture the
Israelites had once possessed, and they no longer had among
them skilled artisans like Bezaleel, who could undertake the
construction or adornment of buildings which might vie with
the palaces of the Philistine or Canaanite cities. Carpenters
and stone-masons had to be fetched from Tyre like the beams
of cedar that were cut on the slopes of the Lebanon. Jaffa,
the port of Jerusalem, must already have fallen by war or
treaty into David’s hand.</p>

<p class='c003'>We are told that the cedar and the workmen were sent by
Hiram, the Tyrian king. But if the Israelitish palace had
been built in the early part of David’s reign, this can hardly
have been the case. Josephus, quoting from the Phœnician
historian Menander, tells us that Hiram <abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr>, the son of Abibal,
reigned thirty-four years (<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 969-936),<a id='r473'></a><a href='#f473' class='c013'><sup>[473]</sup></a> and since he was
still alive in the twentieth year of Solomon’s reign (1 Kings
<abbr title='nine'>ix.</abbr> 10), it would have been Abibal rather than Hiram who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>first entered into commercial alliance with David.<a id='r474'></a><a href='#f474' class='c013'><sup>[474]</sup></a> Abibal
seems, like David, to have been the founder of a dynasty,
and his son and successor was the Solomon of Tyre. He
constructed the two harbours of the city, restored the temples,
and built for himself a sumptuous palace, while his ships
traded to the Straits of Gibraltar in the west and to the
Persian Gulf in the east.</p>

<p class='c003'>Jerusalem became the capital of the Israelitish king, and
the choice was a sign of his usual sagacity. It was an ideal
centre for a kingdom such as his. It lay midway between
Judah and the northern tribes, and thus, as it were, bound
them together. At the same time it belonged to neither;
its associations were Canaanite, not Hebrew, and its choice
as a royal residence could excite no jealousies. Moreover,
this absence of past associations with the history of Israel
enabled David to do with it as he liked; it contained nothing
the destruction or alteration of which would offend the prejudices
of his countrymen. Situated as it was on the borders
of both Judah and Benjamin, it served to unite the houses
of Saul and Jesse, and the mixed population which soon filled
it—partly Jebusite, partly Jewish, and partly Benjaminite—was
a symbol and visible token of that unification of races
and interests in Palestine which it was the work of David’s
reign to effect. In addition to all this, Jerusalem was a
natural fortress, difficult to capture, easy to defend; it had
behind it the traditions of a venerable past, and had once
been the seat of a priest-king.</p>

<p class='c003'>The spoils of foreign conquest allowed David to fortify
and embellish it. Israel as yet had no trade of its own.
The struggle with the Philistines had effectually prevented it
from engaging in the commerce which had made the name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>of ‘Canaanite’ synonymous with that of ‘merchant.’ The
Philistines had held possession of the highroads that ran
through Palestine as well as of the southern line of coast;
the coasts and harbours to the north were occupied by the
Phœnicians. The capture of Joppa from the Zakkal first
opened to Israel and Judah a way to the sea.</p>

<p class='c003'>The fortifications of Jerusalem were completed and the
royal palace built. But the God of Israel to whom David
owed his power and his victories had no habitation there.
Jerusalem had become the capital of the Israelitish monarchy,
yet it was still under the protection of a Canaanitish god.
The time had come when Yahveh should take his place and
assume the protection of David’s capital and David’s throne.</p>

<p class='c003'>In Egypt, in Babylonia, in the cities of Canaan itself, the
palace of the king and the temple of the deity stood side by
side. It was on the temple rather than on the palace that
the wealth of the nation was lavished: while the palace might
be built of brick and stucco, the temple was constructed of
hewn stone. David naturally desired that Yahveh also should
have a fitting habitation in the city He had given to His
worshippers. But the prophet Nathan, who had at first
shared in the plans of David, was commissioned to arrest the
design. David had been a man of war who had ‘shed much
blood upon the earth’;<a id='r475'></a><a href='#f475' class='c013'><sup>[475]</sup></a> until the wars were finished ‘which
were about him on every side’<a id='r476'></a><a href='#f476' class='c013'><sup>[476]</sup></a> Yahveh would not permit
him to build Him a house. All he might do was to prepare
the material for his happier and more peaceful son. Jerusalem
was ‘the city of the god of peace,’ and it was as a god of
peace and not of war that Yahveh would consent to dwell
within it.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nevertheless, though the building of a temple was forbidden,
the new capital of the kingdom was not deprived of the
presence of Yahveh. The ark of the covenant was brought
from the Gibeah or ‘Hill’ of Kirjath-jearim,<a id='r477'></a><a href='#f477' class='c013'><sup>[477]</sup></a> where it had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>lain so long. Placed in ‘a new cart,’ it was led along by oxen,
while David and the Israelites accompanied it with music and
singing. On the road, the oxen stumbled and shook the sacred
palladium of Israel; Uzzah, one of the two drivers, put forth
his hand to steady it, and immediately afterwards fell back
dead. His death was regarded as the punishment of one who,
though not a Levite, had ventured to touch the shrine of
Yahveh, and David in terror and dismay broke up the festal
procession, and left the ark in the nearest house, which
happened to belong to a Philistine of Gath named Obed-Edom.<a id='r478'></a><a href='#f478' class='c013'><sup>[478]</sup></a>
Here it remained three months. Then, David
finding that the household of the Philistine had been blessed
and not cursed by its presence, caused it to be again removed
and taken to Jerusalem. Sacrifices were offered as it passed
along, music once more accompanied it, and David, as
anointed king, clad in the priestly ephod, danced sacred
dances before it. But his wife, Michal, who had seen him
from a window thus acting like one of the inferior priests,
‘despised him in her heart,’ and on his return to the palace
upbraided him with his unseemly conduct. David answered
taunt with taunt; the king could not degrade himself by any
service, however mean, that he might perform in honour of his
God, but Michal herself should be degraded by living the rest
of her life a childless wife. Meanwhile the assembled multitude
was feasted with bread, meat, and wine, and the ark was
reverently placed in ‘the tent’ set up for the purpose in the
midst of Jerusalem. Was this the famous ‘tabernacle of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>congregation’ which had accompanied the Israelites in their
wanderings in the desert, and had afterwards formed part of
the temple-buildings at Shiloh? The fact that it is called ‘the
tent’ would seem to imply that such was the case. On the
other hand, the Chronicler evidently thought otherwise,<a id='r479'></a><a href='#f479' class='c013'><sup>[479]</sup></a> and
we are not told that ‘the tent’ had been brought from
elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c003'>It would seem that the war with the Philistines was over
when the ark was brought to Jerusalem. During its continuance
it is not probable that a native of Gath would be
living peaceably in Israelitish territory, or giving hospitality to
the sacred safeguard of Israel. The Philistines must have
already been incorporated into David’s kingdom, like the
Jebusites of Jerusalem or the Kenites of the south, and his
bodyguard have been recruited from among them. Unfortunately
we do not know how long the war had lasted. A time
came, however, when they acknowledged themselves the
servants of the Israelitish king, and became the vassals of
Judah. They never again were formidable to their neighbours,
nor did they ever seriously dispute the suzerainty of Judah.
It is true that they might now and then take advantage of a
foreign invasion, like that of the Assyrians, to shake off the
yoke of their suzerain, but their independence never lasted
long, and the five cities did not always take the same side.
Even when the very existence of Jerusalem was threatened by
Sennacherib, we find Ekron faithfully supporting Hezekiah
against the Assyrian conqueror. David broke the spirit as
well as the power of the Philistines, and took for ever the
supremacy they had wielded out of their hands.<a id='r480'></a><a href='#f480' class='c013'><sup>[480]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>The ‘lords’ or kings of the five Philistine cities were left
undisturbed. But their position towards David was reversed.
Instead of his being their vassal, they became vassals to him,
paying him tribute, and providing him with military service
when it was required. David was well acquainted with the
excellence of the Philistines as soldiers in war. Accordingly
he followed the example of the Egyptian Pharaohs who had
transformed their Libyan and Sardinian enemies into mercenary
troops, and of the king of Gath in his own case. He
surrounded himself with a bodyguard of Philistines and
Kretans, to whom were afterwards added Karian adventurers
from the south-western coast of Asia Minor. Already in the
age of the Tel el-Amarna tablets Lycians from the same part
of the world had served as mercenaries in Syria, and in the
time of Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> the Hittite army contained troops from
Lycia, from Ionia, and from the Troad. Not only could the
foreigners be used against David’s own countrymen in case of
disaffection or rebellion; their employment about the king’s
person in an office of trust made them feel that they were as
much his subjects as the Israelites themselves, and forget also
that they had been conquered. It was a means of cementing
together the monarchy which the Israelitish king had created.</p>

<p class='c003'>The war with the Philistines was followed by one with
Moab. Here, too, David was successful. The Moabites
were vanquished, and the captives massacred in accordance
with the cruel fashion of the day. Forced to lie along the
ground, two-thirds of the row were measured off with a line
and pitilessly put to death. The result was the almost
complete destruction of the fighting force of the country;
and a century had to pass before Moab recovered its strength,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>and once more regained its independence. It was during the
war with Moab that Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, who was
sprung from the mixed Jewish and Edomite population of
Kabzeel, first came into notice, and was rewarded with a place
among the thirty ‘heroes.’ He slew, we are told, two <span lang="hbo"><i>ariels</i></span>
of Moab.<a id='r481'></a><a href='#f481' class='c013'><sup>[481]</sup></a> The word seems to have specially belonged to
the language of the Moabites. Mesha, on the Moabite Stone,
states that after the conquest of Ataroth and Nebo, he took
from them the <span lang="hbo"><i>arels</i></span> (or <span lang="hbo"><i>ariels</i></span>) of Dodah and Yahveh, and
tore them in pieces before Chemosh,<a id='r482'></a><a href='#f482' class='c013'><sup>[482]</sup></a> and in the Egyptian
<i>Travels of the Mohar</i> the same word is found, having been
borrowed from the Canaanites in the sense of a ‘hero.’<a id='r483'></a><a href='#f483' class='c013'><sup>[483]</sup></a> The
<span lang="hbo"><i>ariels</i></span> slain by Benaiah must therefore have been Moabite
champions like the Philistine Goliath of Gath.</p>

<p class='c003'>Their overthrow was not the only achievement of Benaiah
which qualified him for a place among the <span lang="hbo"><i>gibbôrîm</i></span>. He had
found a lion at the bottom of a cistern in the winter-time when
the ground was covered with snow, and had boldly descended
into the pit and killed it. He had, moreover, slain an Egyptian
in single combat, though armed only with a staff, while his
opponent wielded a spear. These and similar deeds raised
him to the rank of captain of the foreign mercenaries, an office
which he retained throughout the reign of David. Between
him and Joab, the commander of the native army, feelings of
rivalry and ill-will grew up, as perhaps was natural. The
native troops naturally looked askance at the mercenaries,
who formed, as it were, a check upon themselves, and were
favoured by the king with a confidence which they did not
themselves enjoy. The feelings of the troops they commanded
were reflected back upon the two generals, whose
jealousies and counter intrigues ended, finally, in the destruction
of one of them. Benaiah survived, while Joab perished
at the foot of the altar.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>Moab was conquered; it was now the turn of Ammon.
The Ammonites had looked on while their neighbours on the
eastern side of the Jordan were being annexed to the kingdom
of Israel. Nahash, however, the Ammonite king, had long
been the ally of David. A common hostility to Esh-Baal had
brought them together, and the league against the son of Saul
had included Ammon, Judah, and the Aramæans. It was
this alliance which had largely contributed to the success of
David in his war against the northern tribes; left to himself
it is doubtful whether the Jewish prince would have succeeded
in overcoming his rival.</p>

<p class='c003'>While Nahash lived, the old friendship continued between
him and the king of Israel. But with his death came a change.
The ambassadors sent by David to congratulate his son
Khanun on his accession were grossly insulted, and driven
back across the Jordan with their beards half-shorn and their
robes cut off in the middle. Khanun, it was clear, was bent
upon provoking war. He had the Aramæans at his back to
support him; the fate of Moab had alarmed him, and he
determined, while he still possessed allies, to anticipate the
war which he foresaw.</p>

<p class='c003'>The challenge was promptly taken up. Joab and his
brother Abishai marched across the Jordan at the head of a
large army of veterans. A battle took place before ‘the City
of Waters,’ Rabbath-Ammon, ‘the capital of Ammon.’ The
Aramæan forces had already come to the help of their confederates.
Hadad-ezer of Zobah had furnished 20,000 men;
12,000 had come from the land of Tob, and 1000 from Maacah.<a id='r484'></a><a href='#f484' class='c013'><sup>[484]</sup></a>
Joab found himself enclosed between the Aramæans on one
side and the Ammonites on the other. But the Israelitish
general was equal to the danger. Leaving Abishai to resist
the Ammonite attack, he put himself at the head of a picked
body of troops and fell upon the Syrians, whom he succeeded
in utterly routing. The Ammonites, seeing the flight of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>allies, retreated behind the walls of their city, and Joab
remained master of the field.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the battle had been sharply contested, and the Hebrew
army had suffered too severely to be able to pursue its
advantage. Joab retired to Jerusalem, there to recruit his
army and prepare for another campaign. Meantime, the
enemy also had not been idle. Hadad-ezer summoned the
vassal princes of Syria from either side of the Euphrates, and
placed the army under the command of a general named
Shobach. The struggle had passed from a mere war with
Ammon to a contest for the supremacy in Western Asia. The
time had come for David himself once more to take the
field; the issue at stake was too important to be decided by
an inferior commander, however able and experienced.</p>

<p class='c003'>The two great powers on the Euphrates and the Nile, which
had controlled the destinies of the Oriental world in earlier
days, were now in a state of decadence. Egypt was the
shadow of its former self. Its empire in Asia had long since
fallen, and it was now divided into two hostile and equally
impotent kingdoms. The Tanite Pharaohs reigned in the
north, and though their supremacy was theoretically acknowledged
as far as the First Cataract, Upper Egypt was really
governed by the high priests of Ammon at Thebes, who had
blocked the navigation of the Nile by a strong fortress at
El-Hîba, near Feshn, which successfully prevented the rulers
of the Delta from advancing to the south.<a id='r485'></a><a href='#f485' class='c013'><sup>[485]</sup></a> Babylonia was
similarly powerless. A younger rival had grown up in Assyria,
and about <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1290 the Assyrian king Tiglath-Ninip had even
captured Babylon and held possession of it for seven years.
Like Egypt, Babylonia had renounced its claim to rule in
Western Asia, not to renew it till the age of Nebuchadrezzar.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>The kingdom of Mitanni or Aram-Naharaim, moreover,
had passed away; when Tiglath-pileser <abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> of Assyria swept
over Western Asia, in <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1100, it had already become a thing
of the past. Perhaps its overthrow was due to the irruption
of the Hittites from the mountains of Cappadocia, but if so
it was soon avenged, for the Hittites too had ceased to be
formidable. Their empire had dissolved into a number of
small states: one of these was Carchemish, which commanded
the chief ford across the Euphrates; another was Kadesh, on
the Orontes, which had once more sunk into obscurity.</p>

<p class='c003'>In place of Mitanni and the Hittites the Semitic Aramæans
of Syria had risen into prominence. They had been the
older inhabitants of the country, and the decay of the intrusive
powers of Mitanni and the Hittites had enabled them to
shake off the foreign yoke, and establish kingdoms of their
own. Among these, Zobah, called Zubitê in the Assyrian
inscriptions, acquired the leading place.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the closing days of the Assyrian empire, the capital of
Zobah lay to the north-east of Moab—perhaps, as Professor
Friedrich Delitzsch thinks, in the neighbourhood of the modern
Homs.<a id='r486'></a><a href='#f486' class='c013'><sup>[486]</sup></a> It was essentially an Arab state, but had been
founded by those Ishmaelite Arabs of Northern Arabia, who,
like the Nabatheans, had by intercourse with a Canaanite
population developed a dialect which we term Aramaic.
Saul, as we have seen, had been already brought into hostile
collision with them. At that time the tribes of Zobah were
still disunited, and it was with the ‘kings’ or chieftains of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>Zobah that the war of the Israelitish ruler had been carried
on. As in Israel, however, so in Zobah, the necessity of
defending themselves against the enemy had led to union,
and when David reigned at Jerusalem they were under the
sway of a single sovereign, Hadad-ezer, ‘the son of Rehob.’
Rehob had given his name to a district a little to the north of
Palestine, of which Hadad-ezer must have been the hereditary
prince.<a id='r487'></a><a href='#f487' class='c013'><sup>[487]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Hadad-ezer had attempted to establish his empire on the
ruins of that of the Hittites. He had not only unified
Zobah, but had reduced the neighbouring Aramæan princes
to subjection. All northern Syria was tributary to him except
the kingdom of Hamath, and Hamath also was threatened by
the rising power. He had erected a stela commemorating
his victories on the banks of the Euphrates, in imitation of
the ancient Pharaohs of Egypt, and his alliance was courted
by the Aramæans on the eastern side of the river.</p>

<p class='c003'>His career of conquest was suddenly arrested. The
Ammonites, threatened by David, sought his assistance,
and in return for his help offered to acknowledge his
suzerainty. The offer was accepted, and the Syrian king
found himself face to face with the upstart power of Israel.
The war which followed must have been a long one, but it
ended in the complete victory of David. In the brief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>annalistic summary of David’s reign given in 2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr>,
we hear only of one or two of the later incidents in the
campaign. David, it is said, smote Hadad-ezer ‘as he was
marching to restore his stela on the banks of the river’
Euphrates (<abbr title='verse'><i>v.</i></abbr> 3). This implies that the memorial of former
conquests had been destroyed either by the Israelitish king
or by the revolted subjects of Hadad-ezer himself.</p>

<p class='c003'>The account of the war against Ammon (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'>x.</abbr>) shows
that the Israelitish victory must have been subsequent to the
overthrow of the Ammonites. The defeat of Hadad-ezer
was complete. The Israelites captured 1000 chariots, 7000
horsemen,<a id='r488'></a><a href='#f488' class='c013'><sup>[488]</sup></a> and 20,000 foot-soldiers, besides a large number
of horses. The Syrian power, however, was not yet broken.
Damascus rose in defence of its suzerain, and David found
himself once more confronted by a formidable enemy. But
fortune again smiled on the veterans of Israel, and 22,000
Syrians from Damascus were left dead on the field. Israelitish
garrisons were placed in Damascus and the neighbouring
cities, and the rule of David was acknowledged as far as the
frontiers of Hamath.<a id='r489'></a><a href='#f489' class='c013'><sup>[489]</sup></a> Nevertheless, Hadad-ezer was still
unsubdued. His communications with Mesopotamia were
still open across the desert, and it would seem that the last
scene in the war was enacted as far north as Aleppo.</p>

<p class='c003'>A final effort to save Hadad-ezer was made by the Aramæan
states on the eastern side of the Euphrates, who were either
his vassals or his allies. Troops poured across the river,
under the command of Shobach, called Shophach by the
Chronicler. Once more David made a levy of the Israelitish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>forces and led them in person against the foe. He crossed
the Jordan to the south of Mount Hermon, traversed the
territories of Damascus and Homs, and after leaving Hamath
on the left found himself at Helam, where the Aramæan host
had pitched their camp. Josephus in his account of the
campaign transforms Helam, which he reads Khalaman, into
the name of the Aramæan king beyond the Euphrates; we
may accept his reading without following him in changing a
place into a man. Khalaman would correspond exactly with
Khalman, the Assyrian name of Aleppo, which lay on the
high road from the fords of the Euphrates to the west. It
seems probable, therefore, that in Helam or Khalaman, we
must see Aleppo.</p>

<p class='c003'>According to Josephus, who appears to have derived his
account from some Midrash or Commentary on the books of
Samuel, the army of Shobach consisted of 80,000 infantry
and 1000 horse. At all events, in the battle which followed,
and which resulted in the complete victory of the Israelites,
7000 of the Syrian cavalry and 40,000 of their foot-soldiers
are said to have been slain.<a id='r490'></a><a href='#f490' class='c013'><sup>[490]</sup></a> The power of Zobah was
utterly destroyed. All Syria on the western side of the
Euphrates hastened to make peace with the conqueror, and
to offer him homage or alliance. The states on the eastern
bank were separated from their Aramæan kinsfolk to the
west, and as long as David lived took good care not again
to cross the river. The old dream of the Israelitish patriot
was fulfilled, and the dominion of Israel extended northwards
to the borders of Hamath. Even the desert tribes to
the east of Hamath, who had owned obedience to Hadad-ezer,
passed under the sway of David, and for a time at all events
the Jewish king could boast that his rule was acknowledged
as far as the Euphrates.<a id='r491'></a><a href='#f491' class='c013'><sup>[491]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>The immediate result of the victory was a sudden influx of
wealth into the Jewish capital. Not only were the golden
shields carried by the bodyguard of Hadad-ezer brought to
Jerusalem, to be borne on state occasions by the foreign
guards of the conqueror, but immense stores of bronze were
found in two of the cities of northern Syria, Tibhath and
Berothai.<a id='r492'></a><a href='#f492' class='c013'><sup>[492]</sup></a> It was out of this bronze that the fittings of the
temple were afterwards made by Solomon.<a id='r493'></a><a href='#f493' class='c013'><sup>[493]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Another result of the war was an embassy from Toi or Tou
of Hamath. The powerful Hebrew prince who had so
unexpectedly appeared on the horizon of northern Syria was
a neighbour whose goodwill it was necessary to purchase at
all costs. The embassy sent by Toi to David was accordingly
headed by the Hamathite king’s own son. This was
Hadoram, whose name was changed into the corresponding
Hebrew Joram. The change of name was a delicate way of
acknowledging the supremacy of the God of Israel and the
sovereign who worshipped Him, and of declaring that henceforth
Hadad of Syria was to become Yahveh of Israel. As
the Assyrian kings professed to make war in order that they
might spread the name and worship of Assur, so it might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>presumed that the campaigns of David were carried on in
order to glorify Yahveh, who had given him the victory.<a id='r494'></a><a href='#f494' class='c013'><sup>[494]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The ambassadors brought with them various costly gifts,
which Israelitish vanity might, if it chose, interpret as tribute,
and which would certainly have been so interpreted by an
Egyptian or Assyrian scribe. Vessels of gold, silver, and
bronze were laid at the feet of David, and a treaty of alliance
formed between him and the ruler of Hamath. That
Hadad-ezer had been the common enemy of both was a
sufficient pretext both for the embassy and for the alliance.
The memory of the alliance lasted down to a late date. Even
when Azariah reigned over Judah in the time of the Assyrian
king Tiglath-pileser <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>, Hamath could still look to Jerusalem
for help; and in the age of Sargon, Yahu-bihdi, whose name
contains that of the national God of Israel, led the people of
Hamath to revolt.</p>

<p class='c003'>All this while the siege of ‘the City of Waters,’ the Rabbah
or ‘Capital’ of Ammon, still dragged on. Joab was encamped
before it, while David was leading a life of ease and luxury in
his palace at Jerusalem. This neglect of his kingly duties
finds little favour in the eyes of the Hebrew historian. At
the season of the year when David sent Joab and ‘his
servants’ to do his work, other ‘kings’ were accustomed to
‘go forth to battle,’ and special emphasis is laid upon the
words of Uriah: ‘The ark and Israel and Judah abide in
tents; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are
encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house,
to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife?’ With a king
who had thus delegated his proper work to others, and had
already forgotten that the very reason for his existence was
that he should lead the people of Yahveh against their
enemies, a catastrophe could not be far distant. First came
the act of adultery with Bath-sheba, the wife of Uriah the
Hittite, next the treacherous murder of a faithful guardsman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>and brave officer. Uriah was made to carry to Joab the letter
which contained his own death-warrant, as well as that of
other servants of David, equally innocent and equally valorous.
A special messenger brought the king the news of his death,
and Bath-sheba was at once added to the royal harîm. One
man only could be found with courage enough to protest
against the deed; this was Nathan the prophet, a successor
of the Samuel who had placed the crown on David’s head.
The king professed his penitence, though he did not offer to
put away Bath-sheba, and the death of the child he had had
by her was accepted in expiation of his guilt. It was an
example of that vicarious punishment, that substitution of
‘the fruit of the body for the sin of the soul,’ a belief in
which was as strong among the Canaanites as it was in
Babylonia. The second son borne by Bath-sheba received
the double name of Jedidiah from Nathan, and Shelomoh or
Solomon from his father. Shelomoh, ‘the peaceful,’ was, in
fact, the Hebrew equivalent of Salamanu or Solomon, the
name of a king of Moab in the days of Tiglath-pileser <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr><a id='r495'></a><a href='#f495' class='c013'><sup>[495]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>David’s submission gave him a claim upon Nathan which
the prophet never forgot. The death of the first-born of
Bath-sheba, moreover, seemed to indicate that Yahveh had
accepted the sacrifice of the child that had been, as it were,
offered for the sin of the father, and that the guilt of the
Israelitish monarch had been atoned. Henceforward Nathan
took a peculiar interest in the new queen and her offspring.
One of the four sons of Bath-sheba was named after him
(1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 5), and it was to him that Solomon owed in part
his succession to the throne. It may be that Solomon’s
training was intrusted to the prophet; such at any rate may
be the significance of the words in 2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='twelve'>xii.</abbr> 25.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>It was after the birth of Solomon that Rabbah was at
length starved into a surrender. Joab, ever jealous of his
master’s fame, sent to tell David of the fact, and to bid him
come at once and occupy the city lest the glory of its capture
should be credited to the general who had besieged it rather
than to the king who had remained at home. David
accordingly proceeded to the camp, and entered the
Ammonite capital at the head of his troops. The crown of
gold, inlaid with gems, which had adorned the image of
Malcham, the Ammonite god, was placed over the head of
his human conqueror; the city itself was sacked, and its
population treated with merciless rigour. In the euphemistic
language of the historian they were put ‘under saws and
under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made to
pass through the brickkiln.’<a id='r496'></a><a href='#f496' class='c013'><sup>[496]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The war with Ammon was followed by one with Edom.
The Amalekites or Bedâwin had already been taught that a
strong power had arisen in Palestine, thoroughly able to
protect its inhabitants from the raids of the desert robbers
(2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 12); the turn of the Edomites was to come
next. David himself seems to have led the Israelitish army,<a id='r497'></a><a href='#f497' class='c013'><sup>[497]</sup></a>
and in a decisive battle in a wadi south of the Dead Sea,
utterly crushed the forces of Edom.<a id='r498'></a><a href='#f498' class='c013'><sup>[498]</sup></a> Eighteen thousand of
the enemy were slain, and all further resistance on the part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>disciplined troops was at an end. For six months longer the
inhabitants of Mount Seir carried on a guerilla warfare with
Joab; they were, however, mercilessly hunted out and
massacred, hardly a male being left alive (1 Kings <abbr title='eleven'>xi.</abbr> 15).
The child Hadad, the son, it may be, of the last Edomite
king Hadar, was carried by ‘his father’s servants’ to Egypt,
where they found shelter in the court of the Pharaohs, and
David took possession of the depopulated country. Its
possession opened up for Israel a new era of wealth and
commercial prosperity. The high road along which the spices
of southern Arabia were carried ran through it, and at its
southern extremity were the two ports of Elath and Ezion-geber
on the Sea of Suph, which connected Western Asia
with the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. David now commanded
the caravan-trade from the north of Syria to the Gulf
of Aqaba; on the one side he was in contact with Mesopotamia
and Asia Minor, on the other with Egypt and Arabia.
Apart from the trade which passed through Palestine, leaving
riches on its way, the tolls levied on merchandise must have
brought a goodly income to the royal exchequer. David,
indeed, had too much in him of the peasant and the warrior
to realise the full extent of his good fortune; it needed a
Solomon to perceive all the advantages of his position, to fit
out merchant vessels in the Gulf of Aqaba, and to secure a
monopoly of the carrying trade. For the present, David was
occupied in fortifying the conquests he had made. Aramæans
from Ammon and Zobah were drafted into his bodyguard,<a id='r499'></a><a href='#f499' class='c013'><sup>[499]</sup></a>
and Edom was so effectively garrisoned as to make revolt
impossible for more than a century. A firm hold was kept
upon the kinglets of the small Aramæan states to the north
who had formerly owned Hadad-ezer as their suzerain; the
king of Geshur was already connected by marriage with the
royal house of Israel. A new and formidable power had
grown up at the entrance to Egypt, effectually cutting off the
monarchy of the Nile from Western Asia, and the commander-in-chief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>of the Israelitish army had proved himself the ablest
and most irresistible general of his time.</p>

<p class='c003'>David appeared to be securely fixed not only on the throne
of Israel, but also on that of an Israelitish empire. But his
power after all was wanting in stability. It depended in great
measure upon Joab; Joab alone commanded the confidence
of the veteran soldiery, and was dreaded by the foreign foe.<a id='r500'></a><a href='#f500' class='c013'><sup>[500]</sup></a>
Moreover, there was as yet but little real adhesion between
the Israelitish tribes. Ephraim could not forget its old
position of pre-eminence, or cease to resent the domination
of the new-born and half-foreign tribe of Judah. The blood-tax
demanded by the wars of David added to the discontent.
The wars were wars of aggression rather than of defence, and
were to the advantage of a Jewish dynasty, not of the people
as a whole. Military service became as unpopular in Israel
as it has been of recent years in Egypt: when David proposed
to number his subjects and thereby ascertain what fighting
force he possessed, Joab vainly endeavoured to dissuade him
from his intention, and the people subsequently saw in the
plague that followed the punishment of a royal crime. The
bodyguard of Philistines and Kretans, with its officers of
various nationalities and creeds, protected the person of the
king and prevented any open signs of disaffection; but
discontent smouldered beneath the surface, ready to break
into flame whenever a favourable opportunity occurred. The
Israelites had too recently submitted themselves to the rule
of a single sovereign to be as yet amenable to discipline, or to
have lost the democratic instincts of the armed peasant and
his guerilla methods of carrying on war.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was yet another, and a still more potent cause for
the instability of David’s throne. This was to be found in
the royal family itself. Polygamy has been the fatal cancer
which has eaten away the strength and prosperity of the most
powerful dynasties of the Oriental world; and the history of
the Israelitish empire proved no exception to the rule. David
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>had none of the stern and ascetic fanaticism which distinguished
Saul; he enjoyed life to the fullest, and when
success came, policy alone set bounds to his enjoyment of it.
Self-indulgent as most other Oriental despots, he multiplied
to himself wives and children, not shrinking even from the
murder of the trustiest of his followers in his determination to
add yet another beauty to his well-stocked harîm. Polygamy
brought with it its usual curse. In the dull and idle seclusion
of the palace, the wives of the king quarrelled one with
another for his favour and love, and the quarrel of the mother
was adopted by her children. Maachah, the daughter of the
king of Geshur, claimed precedence for herself and her son
Absalom in virtue of their royal blood; Amnon, as the first-born
of his father, regarded himself as rightful heir to the
throne, and as therefore placed above the ordinary laws of
men; while Bath-sheba, whose unscrupulous ambition had
betrayed a husband to destruction, never ceased intriguing in
the interests of Solomon whom she had destined from the
outset for the crown.</p>

<p class='c003'>The latter years of David’s life were clouded with the
crimes and rebellions of his family. Amnon outraged his
half-sister Tamar, and was murdered by her brother Absalom,
and Absalom, his father’s favourite, fled to Talmai, king of
Geshur. Thanks to Joab, the blood-feud was eventually
appeased, and after an exile of three years Absalom was
allowed to return to Jerusalem. Two years later, David
consented to forget the past. Absalom was again received
at court, and his beauty and grace of manner resumed their
former sway over the hearts of both king and people.</p>

<p class='c003'>But David was growing old; discontent was gathering
even among his own tribesmen, and Absalom was impatient
to seize the crown which he conceived to be his by right.
He obtained leave to go to Hebron, there to offer sacrifice
in the ancient sanctuary and capital of Judah. The place
was well chosen: the religious traditions of a venerable past
were associated with the city, and its inhabitants could have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>looked with little favour on the rise of Jerusalem. They gave
ready ear to the prince who promised to restore Hebron to
its ancient importance, and make it once more a capital.
The cry of Hebron and Judah as against Jerusalem and a
dynastic empire was eagerly responded to.</p>

<p class='c003'>David was taken by surprise. Even Joab does not seem
to have been aware of the conspiracy which was being formed.
There were no troops in Jerusalem sufficient to defend it
against attack, even if its defenders could be trusted, and of
this David was no longer sure. He seemed deserted by all
the world, and his only safety lay in flight. Even his counsellor
Ahitophel had gone over to the rebel son.</p>

<p class='c003'>The royal household and harîm fled eastwards across the
Jordan to those outlying districts of Israelitish territory in
which Esh-Baal had so long maintained himself. David was
accompanied by his bodyguard: the priests who wished to
accompany him with the ark were sent back. So, too, was
Hushai, the fellow-councillor of Ahitophel, in the hope that
he might counteract the schemes of Absalom’s adviser.</p>

<p class='c003'>The revolt showed David that he had been living in merely
fancied security. His tribesmen had fallen away from him at
the first summons of his more popular son; his old comrades,
indeed, still stood by him, and he could count on the swords
and fidelity of his foreign bodyguard. But what were they
against a revolted nation? Even in the days of outlawry,
when he was hunted from cave to cave by Saul, he could
reckon on popular sympathy and help; now the popular
sympathy was transferred to another, and the flood-gates of
disaffection and hatred were opened upon him. In spite of
his guards, Shimei of the house of Saul ventured to stone him
as he passed along, and to call him the man of blood who had
unrighteously seized the crown. It was a sign that the fall of
Saul’s dynasty had not been forgotten, and that there were
still those in Benjamin who submitted with reluctance to the
rule of his supplanter.</p>

<p class='c003'>David was saved by the loyalty of Joab. Had that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>invincible general gone over to the enemy a new king would
have sat on the throne of Israel. The commander-in-chief
would have taken his veterans with him and led them, as
ever, to victory. Fortunately for David, his old friend refused
to forsake the fortunes of the fallen king. Perhaps family
jealousies may have had some influence on his resolution.
Absalom conferred the office of commander-in-chief on Amasa,
the son of Joab’s cousin, who had married a man of Israel.<a id='r501'></a><a href='#f501' class='c013'><sup>[501]</sup></a>
The appointment may indeed have been made because Joab
had already thrown in his lot with that of the king; more
probably it had been promised to Amasa before the beginning
of the revolt.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the priests and prophets remained faithful to the king
of their choice. Zadok and Abiathar, the chief priests, had
returned to Jerusalem with the sacred symbol of Yahveh’s
presence in Israel, but their sons Ahimaaz and Johanan
undertook to keep David informed of the plans of his enemies
in the capital. Fortunately for him, the advice of Ahitophel
was only partially acted upon. Absalom possessed himself
of his father’s concubines, and thereby, in accordance with
Hebrew ideas, published to the world his usurpation of the
throne, but the further advice of the wily counsellor was disregarded.
Instead of despatching a body of twelve thousand
men, who should fall upon the fugitives before they could
reach the fords of the Jordan, Absalom and his youthful
friends preferred the counsel of Hushai, and determined first
to raise a levy of all Israel. The idea of marching in person
at the head of a great army appealed to the vanity of the
young usurper; and to the inexperience of youth the possibility
of David and his guards hiding in ambush, and thence
descending upon their unwary pursuers, seemed a very real
danger. Ahitophel, the single representative of age and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>experience among the conspirators, knew only too well what
the rejection of his advice must mean. The rebellion was
self-condemned; it was doomed to failure, and the return of
David would be the destruction of himself. Even at the
council-board of Absalom his rival Hushai had been preferred
to himself; all that was left him was to crawl back to his
home in bitter disappointment, and there hang himself. The
conspiracy had lost the brain which alone could have conducted
it to success.</p>

<p class='c003'>The news of Ahitophel’s advice was brought to David by
the young priests. They had escaped with difficulty from
their hiding-place at the Fuller’s Spring below the southern
extremity of the wall of Jerusalem, and subsequently owed
their preservation to a woman’s wit. The priests were known
to be hostile to the new movement; they had therefore been
watched and closely pursued. They reached David while he
was still on the western side of the Jordan, and no time was
lost in putting the river between himself and his enemies.
The fugitives, however, did not consider themselves safe
until they found themselves at Mahanaim, where they were
in the midst of a friendly population. Ammonites as well as
Gileadites hastened to do honour to David, and to furnish
him with everything that he and his companions required.<a id='r502'></a><a href='#f502' class='c013'><sup>[502]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>He was soon joined by Joab and his brother Abishai, with
the veteran troops under their command. A third division
of the army was placed under Ittai of Gath, a captain in the
royal bodyguard, and the approach of the rebel army was
awaited without anxiety. Amasa made the fatal mistake of
attacking the royal troops in their own territory, on ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>they had chosen for themselves. Not only was it on the
further side of the Jordan, it was also among the trees and dense
undergrowth of the forest of Ephraim.<a id='r503'></a><a href='#f503' class='c013'><sup>[503]</sup></a> The issue could not
be doubtful. David, indeed, had not been allowed by his
followers to enter the field himself. He was now too old for
active service, and his death would involve all the horrors of
a disputed succession and civil war. That Absalom, however,
would be defeated seems to have been taken for granted,
and David accordingly impressed upon his generals that they
should spare his son’s life.</p>

<p class='c003'>But Joab judged more wisely than the king. He knew
that as long as Absalom lived there would be constant trouble
and insecurity, and that for those who had fought against
him on his father’s side there would be but short shrift. As
Absalom, therefore, hung suspended by his hair from the
branches of a tree which had caught him in his flight, he
pierced him with three darts, while his ten armour-bearers
despoiled the corpse. Twenty thousand of the enemy were
said to have been slain, partly by the sword, partly from the
nature of the place in which the battle was fought, and the
slaughter would have been greater had not Joab recalled his
men from their pursuit of the foe as soon as Absalom was
dead. With the fall of the usurper all further danger was at
an end.</p>

<p class='c003'>Ahimaaz, the Levite, famous for his fleetness of foot, ran
with news of the victory to the king. But Joab knew how
fondly David had doted on his handsome and selfish son; he
knew also that he was weakened in both mind and body, and
that the day was past when his emotions could be kept under
control. Joab, therefore, refused to let Ahimaaz carry the
tidings of his son’s death to the king, and an ‘Ethiopian’
slave was sent with the news instead. In the end, however,
Ahimaaz outran the Ethiopian, and announced at Mahanaim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>the victory that had been won. Then came the foreigner
with the message that Absalom was dead.</p>

<p class='c003'>The conduct of David which followed on the message was
indefensible. He forgot that he was a king, that he had
duties towards his people and those who had risked their
lives on his behalf, that the prince who had fallen in open
fight had been the murderer of his brother, a rebel against
his father, and a would-be parricide. All was forgotten and
absorbed in a father’s grief for his dead son. David allowed
the passion of his emotion to sweep him away, and he wept
as a woman and not as a man. It was an outburst of
Oriental exaggeration of feeling, unrestrained and untempered
by the reason or the will.</p>

<p class='c003'>His followers regarded the spectacle with amazement and
dismay. Had it been worth their while to fight for such a
king? One by one they slunk away, and it seemed as if he
would soon be left alone to the company of himself and his
harîm. But once more Joab came to the rescue of his old
master and companion in arms. It was indeed with the
rough speech of the soldier, but plain speech was needed
even though it was rough and rude. ‘Thou hast shamed
this day,’ he said, ‘the faces of all thy servants, which this
day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of
thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy
concubines; in that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy
friends. For thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for
this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had
died this day, then it had pleased thee well. Now therefore
arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I
swear by the Lord, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry
one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee
than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.’</p>

<p class='c003'>David was roused from his selfish and unworthy grief;
weak and self-indulgent as he had become, the words of Joab
nevertheless forced him to recognise the dangers he had
provoked. But he never forgave his monitor. He soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>found an opportunity of punishing Joab for his loyalty, and
his dying orders to his successor were to put his grey-haired
servant to death.</p>

<p class='c003'>Secret word was sent to the priests at Jerusalem that they
should shame the elders of Judah into demanding the return
of the king, seeing that he was their own tribesman, and that
the rest of Israel had already acknowledged his sovereignty.
At the same time Amasa was appointed commander-in-chief
in place of Joab. David thus revenged himself upon his too
outspoken general, and also made a bid for popularity among
the Jewish forces who had followed Amasa.</p>

<p class='c003'>The act was as foolish as it was unjust, and it soon brought
its penalty with it. The elders of Judah indeed begged the
king to return, and he was led across the Jordan in a sort of
triumphal procession by the delegates of that tribe. But the
other tribes resented this appropriation of the royal person.
It was the Jews rather than the rest of Israel who had revolted
and made Absalom their king, while the veterans of Joab who
had remained loyal represented the whole nation. For the
first time since the death of Esh-Baal, the men of Israel and
of Judah stood over against one another with antagonistic
interests and angry rivalry; Israel claimed to have ten parts
in the king, whereas Judah had but one, and yet David’s
action had implied that Judah alone was his rightful heritage.
Hardly was he again in Jerusalem before a new and more
dangerous revolt broke out against his rule. Sheba, a Benjamite,
raised the standard of rebellion, and his cry, ‘We
have no part in David,’ found an echo in the hearts of
the northern tribes. ‘Every man of Israel,’ we are told,
deserted ‘the son of Jesse’; Judah alone adhered to him.
But the strong arm and able brain that had so long fought
for David were no longer there to help him; Joab had been
superseded by Amasa; and the raw levies of Judah who had
escaped from the forest of Ephraim were but a poor substitute
for the disciplined forces which had created an empire.
David at last awoke to the fact that in a moment of weak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>passion he had done his best to throw away a crown; Abishai
was summoned in haste and sent with the bodyguard and
‘Joab’s men’ against the new foe.</p>

<p class='c003'>It would seem that Sheba’s camp had been at Gibeon, not
far to the north of Jerusalem. On the advance of the Jewish
army he retreated northward. Joab had accompanied his
brother, and at ‘the great stone’ of Gibeon the Jewish
forces were overtaken by their new commander-in-chief.
Amasa placed himself at the head of them, clad in the robe
of office which Joab had worn for so many years. The provocation
was great, and the murder of Abner with which Joab
had begun his career was repeated in the murder of Amasa at
the close of it. Abner, however, had been a general of considerable
ability and influence; and Joab had not yet accumulated
so many claims upon the gratitude of the king. The
army took Joab’s side in the matter: Amasa’s body was
thrown into a field with a common cloth above it, and the
Jewish soldiers hurried on along the high-road in pursuit of
the foe. They would have no other commander but Joab,
and his degradation by the king was tacitly set aside.</p>

<p class='c003'>With Joab once more at their head, the insurrection soon
came to an end. Sheba fled to the northern extremity of
Israelitish territory and flung himself into the city of Abel of
Beth-Maachah.<a id='r504'></a><a href='#f504' class='c013'><sup>[504]</sup></a> Here he was closely besieged until ‘a wise
woman’ persuaded her fellow-citizens to cut off his head and
throw it to Joab. The rebellion was over, and Joab returned
in triumph to Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c003'>The last ten years of David’s life were passed in tranquillity.
His bodily and mental powers grew enfeebled, and he sank
slowly into the grave. The hardships of his youth and the
self-indulgence and polygamy of his later years had weakened
his constitution prematurely. While his early companions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>Joab and Abiathar still retained their vigour, the king became
old and worn-out. The intrigues of the harîm, it is true,
still continued, but there was no Absalom to steal away the
hearts of the people by his beauty and winsomeness of
manner; no Amnon to assert in deeds the rights of a crown-prince.</p>

<p class='c003'>Israel was at peace with her neighbours. Edom and
Zobah had been utterly crushed; Moab and Ammon feared
to move while Joab was alive. The petty kings of Northern
Syria paid intermittently their tribute; Tyre and Sidon
courted their powerful neighbour, whose friendship was
preferable to his hostility. Egypt was divided against herself;
more than one dynasty ruled in the country, and the
Tanite sovereigns of the Delta had neither wealth nor men.
Like Egypt, Babylonia had fallen into decay, and the defeat
of the Assyrian king Assur-irbi by the Aramæans had cut off
Assyria from the nations of the West. The Philistines had
been compelled to become the servants of David; and the
pirate-hordes who had flocked to their aid from Krete and
the Ægean now passed into the service of the Israelitish
king, or else transferred their attention to other parts of the
Mediterranean Sea. According to Greek legend, Thrace,
Rhodes, and Phrygia occupied the waters of which they had
once been the masters. Phœnician trading-ships could at
last sail peaceably across them, and Tyre accordingly, under
Abibal and Hiram, became a centre of maritime trade.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the north, the Hittite empire had long since passed
away. Kadesh, on the Orontes, had become the capital of
a small district, formidable to no one, and on good terms
with its Israelitish neighbours.<a id='r505'></a><a href='#f505' class='c013'><sup>[505]</sup></a> Hamath, also, was in
alliance with the Israelitish king. Among the wadis of the
Lebanon, near Damascus, Rezon, indeed, led the life of a
bandit-chief, and robbed the caravans which passed his way;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>but it was not until after David’s death that he succeeded in
establishing himself at Damascus, and there founding a
dynasty of kings.</p>

<p class='c003'>At home, however, though outwardly all seemed calm, the
seeds of disunion and discontent were lying thick below the
surface. The rebellion of Absalom in Judah, of Sheba in
Northern Israel, had shown how fragile were the bonds of union
that bound the tribes to one another and to their king. The
affections of Judah were not yet entwined around the house
of David; the feeling that they were a single nation had not
yet penetrated very deeply into the hearts of the other tribes.
The Davidic dynasty itself was not yet secure. It depended
for its support rather on the sword than on the loyalty of the
people. The fallen dynasty still had its followers and secret
supporters, and now and then an event occurred which
showed how dangerous they might become. Shimei the
Benjamite doubtless represented the feeling of his tribe
when he cursed David in the hour of his humiliation; and
David’s conduct after his restoration to the throne shows that
he could not trust even Merib-Baal or Mephibosheth, the
son of Jonathan, whom he had treated as his own son.<a id='r506'></a><a href='#f506' class='c013'><sup>[506]</sup></a> An
incident which had happened in an earlier part of his reign is
another proof of his readiness to root out as far as possible
the family of Saul. Three years in succession Palestine had
suffered from want of rain and consequent famine, and the
oracle of Yahveh declared that the cause of the visitation was
Saul’s slaughter of the Gibeonites. The massacre of the
priests at Nob had indeed been avenged by the death of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>Israelitish king and his sons, and by the fall of his throne,
but other temple-servants besides the priests had suffered
from Saul’s outburst of mad anger, and their blood was still
crying out for revenge. Blood demanded blood, and the
sacrifice of Saul’s descendants could alone atone for the guilt
of their forefather.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mephibosheth was spared, partly because of his father
Jonathan’s friendship towards David, whose life he had once
saved, partly because little was to be feared from a lame man.
But the five sons of Michal (?) by Adriel of Meholah were
handed over to the executioner.<a id='r507'></a><a href='#f507' class='c013'><sup>[507]</sup></a> They stood too near the
throne; apart from Mephibosheth they were, in fact, the only
direct descendants of the late king, and David was doubtless
glad of the opportunity of removing them from his path.
His dying injunctions to Solomon proved how merciless he
could be when the safety of his dynasty was at stake.</p>

<p class='c003'>Two other descendants of Saul still remained, who might
possibly be a source of trouble. These were the sons of his
concubine Rizpah, and they also were condemned to die.
The sacred number of seven victims was thus made up, and
David satisfied at once the religious scruples of the Gibeonites
and the political exigencies of his own position. Shimei had
some reason for calling him a ‘man of blood’ who had shed
‘the blood of the house of Saul.’</p>

<p class='c003'>The human victims were hanged on the sacred hill of
Gibeah ‘before the Lord,’ and none was allowed to take
the bodies down until at last the rain fell. Then they
were buried solemnly in the ancestral tomb of Saul’s family
at Zelah, along with the ashes of Saul and Jonathan,
which David had brought from Jabesh-gilead. The great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>atonement had been made and accepted by Yahveh, and at
the same time David had cleared himself from all charges
of impiety towards the dead. The fallen dynasty had ceased
to be formidable.</p>

<p class='c003'>Hence it was that when the northern tribes under Sheba
broke away from the house of David, they could find no
representative of the family of Saul to lead them. Sheba, it
is true, was a Benjamite, but he came from Mount Ephraim,
and was not related to Saul. He was rather one of those
military generals who in after days played so large a part in
the history of the northern kingdom in dethroning and founding
dynasties.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nevertheless, the yoke of the royal supremacy was borne
with impatience. In spite of the support of the priesthood
and the swords of Joab and the foreign bodyguard, David’s
reign was troubled by rebellion. As long, indeed, as it was
signalised by victories over a foreign foe, by the conquest of
neighbouring states, by the influx of captive slaves and the
acquisition of spoil, his subjects were well content with their
successful leader in war. His influence over those who were
brought into personal contact with him had always been great,
and there were few who could resist his charm of manner.
But when the era of conquests was past, when David had
delegated his military duties to others, and had retired more
and more into the privacy of an Oriental palace, the seeds of
discontent began to grow and spread. Even in Judah there
were complaints that justice was neglected (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 2-6);
further off the complaints must have been loud and deep.
The unpopularity of the conscription by which the ranks of
the army were filled was patent even to Joab (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-four'>xxiv.</abbr> 3),
and the census on which it depended was regarded as hateful
to God as well as to man.</p>

<p class='c003'>Even David himself half repented of his determination to
number the people (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-four'>xxiv.</abbr> 10), and the general feeling
was expressed by the seer Gad when he declared that the
punishment of heaven would be visited for the deed, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>indeed upon the guilty king, but upon his innocent subjects
(2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-four'>xxiv.</abbr> 13, 17). In the plague that devastated Palestine
they saw the anger of Yahveh, and the conscience-stricken
king at once assented to the common view.</p>

<p class='c003'>The cessation of the plague was connected with the foundation
of the temple. At the very spot where David had seen
the angel of death standing with his sword unsheathed, the
altar was built and the sacrifice offered which appeased the
wrath of the Lord. It was the threshing-floor of Araunah
the Jebusite, on the level summit of Mount Moriah, where
the old Jebusite population of Jerusalem still dwelt. It may
even be that Araunah was the last Jebusite king whose life
and freedom were spared when Jerusalem was surrendered to
David.<a id='r508'></a><a href='#f508' class='c013'><sup>[508]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The threshing-floor was bought by David, and became the
great ‘high-place’ of the new capital of the kingdom. Everything
marked it out as the site of that temple which in the
Eastern world was a necessary supplement of the royal palace.
It was the highest part of the city; it was, moreover, a smooth
and sunny rock, and the place which it occupied was open
and unconfined. It had been the scene of a special revelation
of Yahveh to the king, and the altar erected on it had
been the means of preserving the people of Israel from death.
It is possible, too, that the spot was already sacred. In the
Tel el-Amarna tablets, Ebed-Tob, king of Jerusalem, speaks
of the Temple of Nin-ip as standing on ‘the mountain of
Uru-salim,’ and of all the mountains of Jerusalem the future
temple-mount was the most prominent and commanding.</p>

<p class='c003'>We do not know when the pestilence occurred which thus
had such momentous consequences for the later religion of
Judah. The empire of David already extended as far as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>‘Kadesh of the Hittites,’<a id='r509'></a><a href='#f509' class='c013'><sup>[509]</sup></a> but Edom does not as yet seem to
have become a province of Israel. The census was taken in
order to ascertain the number of fighting men in Israel, not
with a view to the levying of taxes. In the latter case the
conquered provinces would have been included in the registration.
We may gather, therefore, that the event happened
about the middle of David’s reign, probably at the time when
the struggle with Zobah was still going on.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was at a later period, when ‘the Lord had given him
rest round about from all his enemies’ (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='seven'>vii.</abbr> 1), that he
announced to Nathan his purpose of building a temple.
Nathan had taken Gad’s place as the seer and confidant of
the king, and the palace of David had already been erected.
But Yahveh would not allow him to carry out his plan. His
hands were stained too deeply with blood; the work was
destined for the son whose name signified ‘the peaceful one,’
and in whose birth and training the seer had taken so profound
an interest.<a id='r510'></a><a href='#f510' class='c013'><sup>[510]</sup></a> All that David could do was to prepare the way
for his successor, to collect the materials for the work, and to
determine the place whereon the temple of God should
stand.</p>

<p class='c003'>Two lists have come down to us of David’s chief officers,
extracted from the State annals. The first list is given at the
end of the annalistic summary of the events of his reign
(2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 16-18), and belongs to the earlier portion of it;
the second must have been drawn up not long before his
death. From the outset, it is clear, the kingdom was as
thoroughly organised as that of the surrounding states. There
was the ‘recorder’ or ‘chronicler’ whose duty it was to hand
down the memory of all that happened to future generations;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>the scribe or chief secretary who wrote and answered official
letters, and superintended the copying and re-editing of older
documents in the record office; the commander-in-chief of
the army, who corresponded to the <i>turtannu</i> or tartan of the
Assyrians, and the commander of the foreign troops. The
administration, in fact, seems to have closely resembled that
of Assyria, excepting only that there was no Vizier or Prime
Minister who acted as the representative of the king. It
presupposes a long-established use of writing and all the
machinery of a civilised Oriental state. The scribe and the
chronicler make their appearance in Israel simultaneously
with the establishment of an organised government. A
knowledge of the art of writing could have been no new thing.</p>

<p class='c003'>Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, we are told, was the
recorder, Seraiah was the secretary,<a id='r511'></a><a href='#f511' class='c013'><sup>[511]</sup></a> Benaiah the commander
of the Kretan and Philistine bodyguard. By the side of the
civil functionaries were the two high priests Zadok and
Abiathar, while the office of royal chaplains was filled by the
sons of David himself. Their duties were probably to offer such
sacrifices as were not public in the absence or in place of their
father. That there should have been two high priests is difficult
to explain. Zadok was the son of Ahitub, whom the Chronicler
makes the son of Amariah, and a descendant of Phinehas the
son of Eleazar (1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='six'>vi.</abbr> 7), while Abiathar was the son of
Ahimelech or Ahiah, the grandson of Ahitub, and great-grandson
of Phinehas the son of Eli.<a id='r512'></a><a href='#f512' class='c013'><sup>[512]</sup></a> Abiathar appears to have represented
the family of Ithamar the younger brother of Eleazar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>the son of Aaron; at any rate, it was to his family that the
safe keeping of the ark had been intrusted as well as the
high priesthood at the sanctuary of Shiloh. The destruction
of Shiloh dealt a blow at its influence and <i>prestige</i>, the
massacre of the priests at Nob almost annihilated it. Room
was thus given for another line of priests who claimed descent
from the elder branch of Aaron’s family, and who had probably
preserved the Mosaic tradition in another part of Israel. Is
it possible that Zadok had followed the fortunes of Esh-Baal,
while Abiathar attached himself to David? At all events,
the unification of the kingdom brought with it the unification
of the high-priestly families; throughout the greater part of
David’s reign the ark at Jerusalem was served by both Zadok
and Abiathar, with numerous Levites under them (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv.</abbr>
24-29). That Zadok is always named first, though Abiathar
had been the early friend and priest of David, implies that his
claim to represent the elder branch of the high priest’s family
was recognised.</p>

<p class='c003'>When the second list of David’s officials was compiled
certain important changes had taken place. Seraiah, the
secretary, had been succeeded by Sheva or Shisha (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr>
<abbr title='twenty'>xx.</abbr> 25; 1 Kings <abbr title='four'>iv.</abbr> 3); ‘Ira, the Jairite,’ had become the
chaplain of David, and the growth of the empire had
necessitated the creation of a new office. This was the
imperial treasurership which was held by a certain Hadoram,
who seems to have been of Syrian origin, and whose duty it
was to collect the tribute of the conquered provinces.<a id='r513'></a><a href='#f513' class='c013'><sup>[513]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>Possibly he had already gained experience of the office under
one of the Syrian kings.</p>

<p class='c003'>Other officers of David are enumerated by the Chronicler
(1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-seven'>xxvii.</abbr> 25-34). They had their analogues in Assyria
and Egypt, and show how thoroughly the court of Israel was
modelled after those of the neighbouring states. Among
them we read of Azmaveth, the son of Adiel, who presided
over the exchequer; of Jonathan, the son of Uzziah, who
superintended the public granaries, which must therefore have
been established in imitation of those of Egypt and Babylonia;<a id='r514'></a><a href='#f514' class='c013'><sup>[514]</sup></a>
of Ezri, the superintendent of the peasants who worked on
the crown lands; of Shimei and Zabdi, who had charge of the
royal vineyards and wine-cellars; of Baal-hanan and Joash, to
whom were intrusted the olive plantations and storehouses of
oil; of Obil, the Ishmaelite, the chief of the camel-drivers; of
Jehdeiah, the head of the ass-drivers; and of Jaziz, the
Hagarene, who superintended the shepherds of the king.<a id='r515'></a><a href='#f515' class='c013'><sup>[515]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>David sank slowly into the grave, old in mind as well as in
years. A young maiden, Abishag the Shunammite, was
brought to lie beside the king, and so keep up the warmth of
his body. But it was all in vain, and it became clear that he
could not last long. The bed of the dying king was surrounded
by intrigue. Adonijah, the eldest of his surviving sons,
naturally looked upon himself as the rightful heir. He could
count upon two powerful supporters. One was the priest
Abiathar, who had first given David’s title to the crown a
religious sanction; the other was Joab, who had created his
empire. But Bath-sheba had long since determined that she
should be queen-mother, and that her son Solomon should
wear the crown. Behind her stood Nathan, the spiritual
director both of herself and of her son. The adhesion of
Abiathar and Joab to Adonijah, moreover, drove their rivals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>Zadok and Benaiah into the opposite camp, and Benaiah
took with him the foreign bodyguard of which he was
commander, and which, as in other countries, thus showed
itself ready from the outset to make and unmake kings. Above
all, Bath-sheba still exercised her old influence over the half-conscious
monarch, and it did not need the incitements of
Nathan to induce her to exert it once more on behalf of
Solomon. Backed as she was by the prophet, the issue was
not doubtful, and David did as he was bid. Bath-sheba
reminded him of his old promise to herself, Nathan craftily
represented that Adonijah was already seizing the crown
before his father’s life was extinct.</p>

<p class='c003'>Zadok and Benaiah were accordingly summoned, and
ordered to escort the young prince on David’s own mule
to the spring of Gihon, and there, just outside the eastern
wall of Jerusalem, where the Spring of the Virgin now gushes
from the ground, to anoint him with the oil of consecration,
and proclaim his accession by the sound of trumpet. The
presence of the priests and the bodyguard was a visible sign
that the kingship and the power had been transferred from
David to Solomon.</p>

<p class='c003'>Meanwhile Adonijah was holding a feast at the stone of
Zoheleth, near En-Rogel, the Fuller’s Spring, the modern
Well of Job south of the Pool of Siloam. Abiathar and Joab
were with him; so also were his brothers, who seem to have
had but little affection for the favourite of Nathan, as well as
those representatives of Judah who had been the mainstay of
Absalom’s rebellion. Solomon appears to have been regarded
as tainted by foreign blood; at all events, Judah followed
Adonijah as it had followed Absalom.<a id='r516'></a><a href='#f516' class='c013'><sup>[516]</sup></a> But Nathan and
Bath-sheba had taken their measures in time. In the midst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>of the feast news was brought to the conspirators by Johanan,
the son of Abiathar, that Solomon had been proclaimed
king, and that his person was already protected by the royal
bodyguard. The guests fled in dismay, and Adonijah took
refuge at the altar. There the sovereign-elect promised him
that he would spare his life.</p>

<p class='c003'>Solomon next received the last commands of the dying
king. David’s last thought was for the maintenance of the
kingdom and the dynasty. Solomon was to follow in the
footsteps of his father, to obey the law of Yahveh and His
priests. More especially he was to seek an early opportunity
of ridding himself of possible rivals or antagonists whom the
weakness or policy of David himself had hitherto spared.
Joab was to be put to death; he was too powerful a subject
to be allowed to live, aged though he now was, and his complicity
with Adonijah made him dangerous to the new king.
Shimei, too, was to be slain; as long as he lived the fallen
dynasty had a leader around whom the disaffected might
rally. On the other hand, the kindness of Barzillai, the
Gileadite, was not to be forgotten; favour to him would win
the hearts of the men of Gilead.<a id='r517'></a><a href='#f517' class='c013'><sup>[517]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>David died, leaving behind him a name which his countrymen
never forgot. He became the ideal of a patriot king.
He had founded a dynasty and an empire; and though the
empire soon fell to pieces, the dynasty survived and exercised
a momentous influence upon the religious history of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>world. He had established once for all the principle of
monarchy in Israel; never again could the Israelites return
to the anarchic days of the Judges, or forget the lessons of
unity which they had been taught.</p>

<p class='c003'>In character he was generous and kind-hearted, though in
his later years his kindheartedness degenerated into weakness.
He was, moreover, brave and skilful, with a personal charm
of manner and readiness of speech which those about him
found it impossible to withstand. Alone of his sons, Absalom
seems to have inherited these gifts of his father, which may
perhaps account for the blind love David had for him.
But along with these gifts went a rich fund of Oriental
selfishness, which made him never lose an opportunity of
securing his own advantage or promotion. It was a selfishness
so deep as to be wholly unconscious; whatever made
for his interests was necessarily right. It was combined with
clearness of head and definiteness of aim, which ensured
success in whatever he undertook. A good judge of men, he
first attached them to himself by his gifts of manner, and then
knew how to trust and employ them.</p>

<p class='c003'>With the strong and healthy mind of the peasant there was,
however, combined a depth of passionate emotion which
doubtless had much to do with the influence he possessed
over others. David was a man of strong impulses, and we
cannot understand his character unless we remember the fact.
The impulses, it is true, were controlled and regulated by the
cool judgment and politic self-restraint which distinguished
more especially his earlier life; but they swayed him to the
end, sometimes for good, sometimes for evil. Above all, he
was a religious man, deeply attached to the faith into which
he had been born, full of trust in priests and prophets and
oracles, and convinced that Yahveh would protect and
befriend him as long as he obeyed the divine law. But
there was neither asceticism nor fanaticism in his religion; it
was the firm faith and religious conviction of a healthy mind.</p>

<p class='c003'>David was not cruel by nature; if he showed himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>merciless at times, it was either for reasons of policy, or
because the action was in accordance with the public opinion
of the age. The Assyrian kings gloat over the barbarities
they practised towards their conquered enemies, and the
Hebrew Semite similarly prayed that Yahveh might dip His
foot in the blood of His foes. David might indeed be a man
of blood, but by the side of the rulers of Nineveh he was
mercy itself; and the very fact that the blood he had shed
prevented him from building a temple to his God shows how
different the conception of Yahveh must have been from that
which prevailed among the neighbouring nations of their own
deities.</p>

<p class='c003'>Such, then, was David’s character, with all its apparent
anomalies. Brave and active, clear-headed and politic,
generous and kind-hearted, he was at the same time selfish
and impulsive, at times unforgiving and merciless. He had
nevertheless a genuine and fervid trust in Yahveh, and a
fixed belief that Yahveh demanded an upright life and ‘clean
hands.’ Up to the last he remained at heart the Oriental
peasant, who takes a healthy view of life, whose shrewdness
is crossed and chequered by the impulses of the moment,
and whose religion is deep and unquestioning. But, like the
peasant, he failed to be proof against success and prosperity.
The bold and hardy warrior degenerated into the self-indulgent
and even sensual despot. It is true that he
repented of the crimes to which his self-indulgence had
led, and which to most other Oriental despots would have
soon become a second nature; the self-indulgence, however,
remained, and a weak will and infirmity of purpose marred
the latter years of his life.</p>

<p class='c003'>Future generations saw in him the ‘sweet psalmist of
Israel.’ As far back as we can trace it, tradition averred
that a large part of the psalter owed its origin to him. It
has been left for the nineteenth century to be wiser than the
past, and to deny to David the authorship of even a single
psalm. But there are some of them which seem to bear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>their Davidic authorship on their face,<a id='r518'></a><a href='#f518' class='c013'><sup>[518]</sup></a> and if there are many
which belong to a later date, while others are pieced together
from earlier fragments,<a id='r519'></a><a href='#f519' class='c013'><sup>[519]</sup></a> this is only what we should expect
when once the nucleus of a collection had been formed, and
the psalms embodied in it employed liturgically. Assyrian
discovery has shown that penitential psalms, similar in spirit
and form to those of David, had been composed in Babylonia
centuries before his time, and there collected together for
liturgical purposes.<a id='r520'></a><a href='#f520' class='c013'><sup>[520]</sup></a> In Egypt, what we should call ‘Messianic
psalms’ had been written before the age of the Exodus.<a id='r521'></a><a href='#f521' class='c013'><sup>[521]</sup></a>
There is, therefore, no reason why a part of the Hebrew
psalter should not belong to the Davidic period, and be the
work of David himself. There is nothing in it inconsistent
with the character of David or the ideas of his time. It is
only the false theory of ‘the development of Hebrew religion’
which finds in it the religious conceptions of a later era.
Those indeed who maintain that in the age of David the law
of Moses was as yet unknown, and that faith in Yahveh was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>hardly to be distinguished from that in Baal or Chemosh,
may be compelled to deny that any of the psalms, with their
high spiritual level, can belong to the king who was ‘after
God’s own heart’; but history cannot take note of theories
which are built upon assumptions and not facts. Even in
the northern kingdom of Israel, where the memory of the
founder of the Davidic dynasty was naturally held in little
esteem, tradition was obliged to confess that he had been the
inventor of ‘instruments of music’ (<abbr title='Amos'>Am.</abbr> <abbr title='six'>vi.</abbr> 5).</p>

<p class='c003'>The exact date of David’s death is doubtful. The
chronology of the books of Kings, so long the despair of
chronologists, has at length been corrected by the synchronisms
that have been established between the history
of Israel and Judah and that of Assyria. Thanks to the
so-called Lists of Eponyms or Officers from whom the years
of the state calendar took their name, we now possess an
exact chronology of Assyria from <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 911. In <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 854
Ahab took part in the battle of Qarqar, which was fought by
the princes of the west against their Assyrian invaders, and
his death, therefore, could not have happened till after that
date. In <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 842 Jehu offered homage to the Assyrian
monarch, and Hazael of Damascus was defeated in a battle
on Mount Shenir. Four years previously the Syrian opponent
of the Assyrians was Hadad-idri or Ben-Hadad. Lastly,
Menahem of Israel paid tribute to Tiglath-pileser <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> in
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 738, Pekah and Rezin were overthrown in <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 734, and
Damascus was taken and destroyed by the Assyrian king in
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 732. It is only after the capture of Samaria by Sargon
in <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 722, when the kingdom of Judah stands alone, that
the Biblical dates harmonise with the Assyrian evidence, or
indeed with one another. It is evident, therefore, that the
Biblical chronology is more than forty years in excess. Ahab,
instead of dying in <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 898, as Archbishop Usher’s chronology
makes him do, cannot have died till some forty-five years
later. We have no means of checking the earlier chronology
of the divided kingdom, but assuming its correctness, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>revolt of the Ten Tribes would have taken place about
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 930.</p>

<p class='c003'>Solomon, like Saul, is said to have reigned forty years.
But this merely means that the precise length of his reign
was unknown to the compiler. It could not have exceeded
thirty years. Hadoram, who was ‘over the tribute’ in the latter
part of David’s life (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty'>xx.</abbr> 24), still occupied the same
office in the first year of Rehoboam’s reign (1 Kings <abbr title='twelve'>xii.</abbr> 18),
and Rezon, who had fled from Zobah when David conquered
the country, was ‘an adversary to Israel all the days of
Solomon’ (1 Kings <abbr title='eleven'>xi.</abbr> 24, 25). No clue is given by the
statement of Rehoboam’s age in 1 Kings <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 21, since when
it is said that he was ‘forty and one years’ at the time of his
accession this is merely equivalent to ‘<abbr class='spell'><i>x</i></abbr> + 1.’</p>

<p class='c003'>The length of David’s reign is more accurately fixed.
Seven years and a half did he reign in Hebron, and thirty-three
years over Israel and Judah (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv.</abbr> 5), or forty and
a half years in all. Approximately, therefore, we may date
his reign from <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1000 to 960. Saul’s accession may have
been ten or fifteen years earlier.</p>

<p class='c003'>David’s palace at Jerusalem, it is stated in 2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v.</abbr> 11,
was built by the artisans of Hiram of Tyre, who also furnished
him with cedar wood. The fragment of Tyrian annals quoted
by Josephus from Menander<a id='r522'></a><a href='#f522' class='c013'><sup>[522]</sup></a> throws some light on the
chronology of the time. Hiram, we are told, was the son of
Abibal, and the names of his successors are recorded one
after the other, together with the length of their reigns. But
unfortunately the sum of the reigns does not agree with their
total as twice given by Josephus, nor indeed are our authorities
agreed among themselves in regard to the length of certain of
them. The fact, however, that Josephus twice gives the same
total raises a presumption in its favour, more especially when
we find that it is possible by a little manipulation to make the
sum of the several reigns harmonise with it.<a id='r523'></a><a href='#f523' class='c013'><sup>[523]</sup></a> This total is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>one hundred and forty-three years and eight months, which,
it is said, elapsed from the building of Solomon’s temple in
the twelfth year of Hiram down to the foundation of Carthage
in the seventh year of Pygmalion. But the date of the foundation
of Carthage is itself not a wholly certain quantity,
though <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 826 is probably that which was assigned to it by
the native historians.<a id='r524'></a><a href='#f524' class='c013'><sup>[524]</sup></a> A hundred and forty-three years and
eight months reckoned back from 826 would bring us to
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 969 or 970. As the temple was begun in the fourth
year of Solomon’s reign (1 Kings <abbr title='six'>vi.</abbr> 1), this would give
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 973 for the accession of Solomon, and <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1013 for
that of David. The palace constructed for David at Jerusalem
by the workmen of Hiram must have been erected at the very
end of David’s life, after the suppression of the revolt of
Absalom, unless, indeed, the author of the books of Samuel
has mistaken the name of the Tyrian king, and written Hiram
instead of Abibal.</p>

<p class='c003'>There is yet another synchronism between Hebrew and
profane history which must not be overlooked. Jerusalem
was captured in the fifth year of Rehoboam by Shishak <abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr>,
the founder of the twenty-second Egyptian dynasty. But
Egyptian chronology is more disputable even than that of
Israel, and we do not know in what year of the Pharaoh’s
reign the invasion of Palestine took place. Boeckh, on the
authority of Manetho, places the commencement of his reign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>in <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 934; Unger, on the same authority, in <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 930; while
Lepsius pushes it back to <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 961.</p>

<p class='c003'>On the whole, then, we must be content with approximate
dates for the founders of the Hebrew monarchy. The revolt
of the Ten Tribes will have taken place somewhere between
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 940 and 930; the accession of David somewhere between
<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1010 and 1000. It coincided with the period when the
older kingdoms of the Oriental world—Babylonia, Assyria,
and Egypt—were in their lowest stage of weakness and decay.</p>

<p class='c003'>Solomon succeeded to a brilliant heritage. The nations
which surrounded him had been conquered or forced into
alliance with Israel; there was none among them adventurous
or strong enough to attack the newly risen power. The
caravan-roads which brought the merchandise of both north
and south to the wealthy states of Western Asia passed
through Israelitish territory; Edom, which communicated
with the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, was in Jewish hands,
as well as Zobah, which commanded the road to the Euphrates.
The tolls levied on the trade which thus passed
through the empire filled the treasury at Jerusalem with
abundant riches, while the products and luxuries of the whole
eastern world flowed into the Hebrew market. The alliance
with the Tyrians gave Solomon a port in the Mediterranean;
the possession of Edom gave him ports of his own in the
Gulf of Aqaba. In return for the use of the Edomite
harbours by the ships of Phœnicia, he was allowed to send
forth merchantmen of his own from the havens of Hiram on
the Phœnician coast. The ships themselves were manned
with Phœnician sailors; like the Assyrian kings in later days
he had to turn to the experienced mariners of Phœnicia to
work his fleet.</p>

<p class='c003'>At home the kingdom had been fully organised. There
were an army of veterans, a foreign bodyguard, who had no
interests beyond those of the master who paid them, a well-selected
capital, and a fiscal administration. The revolts
which had disturbed the later years of David had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>suppressed with a heavy hand, and such murmurs as may
have been raised against the enfeebled government and
neglected justice of the late reign were hushed in presence
of a young and well-educated prince, the <i>protégé</i> of priests
and prophets, whose very name promised his people the
blessings of peace. The wars of David, with their tax of
blood and treasure, were at an end. Those who had conspired
against the elevation of Solomon to the throne had
been put to death at the outset of his reign: the grey hairs
of Joab were stained with his own blood as he clung to the
unavailing altar; Adonijah was executed on the ground that
he had asked to have Abishag for a wife, and it was not long
before a pretext was found for removing Shimei out of the
way. Benjamin and Judah had alike lost their leaders, and
Solomon henceforth did his utmost to win them to himself.</p>

<p class='c003'>Abiathar was banished to the priests’ city of Anathoth, and
the glory of the high priesthood was left to Zadok and his
descendants alone. They alone were allowed to serve before
the ark of the covenant, and the doom pronounced upon the
house of Eli was thus fulfilled. The act placed the religion
of Israel for many generations to come under the domination
of the king. Solomon declared by it his supremacy in
the church as well as in the state. It meant that the king
claimed the power and the right to appoint and dismiss the
ministers of the Mosaic law. The central sanctuary became
the royal chapel rather than the temple of the national God,
and its priests were the paid officials of the sovereign rather
than the administrators and interpreters to the people of the
divine law. The democratic element passed out of Hebrew
religion, and the king more than the high priest came to stand
at the head of it. The erection of the temple completed the
work which the deposition of Abiathar had begun; sanctuary,
services, and priesthood were all alike under the royal control.
The family of Eli had preserved the tradition of the days
when the priests of Shiloh exercised independent authority,
and interpreted the law which all were called upon to obey.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>With the banishment of Abiathar came a break with the past;
no venerable memories were connected with the rival house
of Zadok, no recollection of a time when the word of the
priest of Shiloh had been a teacher in Israel. Under Zadok
and his successors the old meaning of the high priesthood
gradually faded out of sight; as in Assyria or Southern
Arabia the priests of an earlier age were supplanted by kings,
so too in Israel the place and influence of the high priest were
absorbed by the Davidic dynasty. Even a Jeroboam could
assert his right to establish sanctuaries and appoint the
priests who should serve them.</p>

<p class='c003'>Solomon had been brought up under the eye and instruction
of Nathan, and to Nathan, therefore, we must probably
trace his religious policy. There was much to be said in
favour of it. It prevented friction between the priesthood
and the monarchy; it guaranteed the stability of the dynasty
of David by extending to it the sanction of religion; above
all, it secured the maintenance of the religion itself. It gave
it as it were a local habitation in a costly sanctuary built and
endowed out of the royal revenues, and attached to the royal
palace. The ark ceased to be national, and became instead
the sacred treasure of the chapel of the king. While the
monarchy lasted, the religion of the monarchy would last also,
and Nathan and Zadok might be pardoned if they believed
that the Davidic monarchy would last for ever.</p>

<p class='c003'>The administration of the country next claimed the attention
of the new king. It was organised on an Assyrian
model, Palestine being divided into districts, each of which
was placed under a governor who was responsible for the
taxes as well as for the civil and judicial government of it.
Hitherto, it would appear, the old system of tribal government
had been preserved, the tribes owning allegiance to
hereditary chieftains or ‘princes,’ who, like the chieftains of a
Highland clan, represented the tribe, and led its members to
war. David seems to have modified this system for military
purposes, if we may judge from the list of ‘captains’ given in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-seven'>xxvii.</abbr>, but no attempt was made to carry out a general
system of taxation, or appoint governors with fiscal powers.
The conquered provinces alone were required to furnish an
annual tribute to the treasury, and for this a single officer,
Hadoram, was found sufficient.</p>

<p class='c003'>The territory of the Israelites themselves was now formed
into fiscal districts. Twelve officers were appointed, who
were required to provide in turn for the necessary expenses of
the royal household during the twelve months of the year.
A list of them, extracted from some official document, is given
in 1 Kings <abbr title='four'>iv.</abbr> 8-19. In the earlier part of the list the names
of the officers have been lost, those only of their fathers
having been preserved. Two of them were married to
daughters of Solomon, indicating that the list must have
been drawn up towards the end of Solomon’s life. One of
the king’s sons-in-law was the governor of Naphtali; the other
presided over the Phœnician coast-land south of Tyre.
Here, at Dor, in a country occupied by the Zakkal kinsmen
of the Philistines, and in proximity to Tyre, it was
needful that the prefect should be connected with the king
by closer ties than those of officialism. The direction of the
Mediterranean trade was mainly in his hands, and the
resources which were thus at his disposal, as well as the
neighbourhood of Hiram, might have tried the loyalty of any
but a relative of the king. The plateau of Bashan was under
the jurisdiction of one governor who had his residence at
Ramoth-gilead; Gilead was under a second, while a third
governor had Mahanaim. We may, therefore, gather that
Ammon and Moab, as well as Geshur, had been absorbed
into Israelitish territory. This may in part explain why at
the revolt of the Ten Tribes Moab went with Israel rather
than with Judah.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is noticeable that there was no governor in Judah.
Here, in fact, the king himself ruled in person. It would
seem that Judah was exempt from the taxes levied on the rest
of Palestine. This was in accordance with the policy which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>made Solomon court the goodwill of his father’s tribe, and
identify with its interests those of himself and his house. So
far as the continuance of the Davidic dynasty was concerned,
the policy succeeded. Judah identified itself with the house
of David, and rallied faithfully round its king. There was no
longer any talk of rebellion, or of transporting the capital to
Hebron; from henceforth Judah and its kings were one.
But the fact only made the breach between Judah and the
rest of Israel wider and more visible, and alienated the other
tribes from the reigning house. They were treated like the
conquered Gentiles; the place of their old hereditary princes
and leaders was taken by governors appointed by the crown,
and fixed taxes were rigorously exacted from them for the
support of the royal treasury. They derived no benefit,
however, from the royal expenditure; it was lavished upon
Jerusalem and the Jewish towns which lay near to it. They
were too far off to see even a reflection of that royal glory
of which they may have heard, and for which they certainly
had to pay. The same causes which strengthened the ties of
allegiance of Judah to the reigning dynasty weakened those
of Israel.</p>

<p class='c003'>Throughout the reign of Solomon, Hadoram remained
‘over the tribute,’ and his duties were enlarged by the
supervision of the home taxation and <i>corvée</i> being added to
that of the foreign tribute.<a id='r525'></a><a href='#f525' class='c013'><sup>[525]</sup></a> Jehoshaphat still continued
‘recorder,’ but the secretary Shisha had been succeeded by
his two sons. The literary correspondence of the empire was
increasing, and one chief secretary was no longer sufficient
for it. The family of Nathan, as might have been expected,
was well provided for. One son was made Vizier; the other
became the royal chaplain as well as ‘the king’s friend.’
The latter title, which had been given to Hushai in the time
of David (1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-seven'>xxvii.</abbr> 33), had been borrowed from Egypt;
the title of the Vizier, or ‘head of the officers,’ corresponded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>with the Assyrian Rab-saki or Rabshakeh, ‘the chief of the
princes.’ Another office which may have been borrowed
from Assyria was that of royal steward, which was held by
Ahishar; along with him the Septuagint associates a second
steward Eliak, and a captain of the bodyguard called Eliab,
the son of Saph or Shaphat.<a id='r526'></a><a href='#f526' class='c013'><sup>[526]</sup></a> Like the list of governors, the
list of officials must have been drawn up at the end of
Solomon’s reign, since Azariah has already taken the place of
his grandfather Zadok as high priest (see 1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='six'>vi.</abbr> 9, 10,
where a confusion has been made between Ahimaaz the son
of Zadok and Johanan or Jonathan the son of Abiathar). It
is significant that the list begins with the ‘priest,’ not with the
general of the army as in the warlike days of David.</p>

<p class='c003'>The fame of Solomon’s wealth and magnificence was
spread through the Oriental world. Foreign sovereigns sought
his alliance or courted his favour. Even the Queen of Sheba
came to visit him. Modern criticism has long since banished
the Queen to the realm of fiction, but archæological discovery
has again restored her to history. Sheba or Saba was already
a flourishing kingdom in the time of the Assyrian king
Tiglath-pileser <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>; its territories extended from the spice-bearing
coasts of Southern Arabia to the borders of Babylonia
and Palestine. If Glaser and Hommel are right in their
interpretation of the south Arabian inscriptions, it had
entered on the older heritage of the kingdom of Ma’ân. The
Minæan kings of Ma’ân had ruled not only in the south but
in the north as well; their records are found near Teima, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>they had command of the great highroad of commerce which
led from the Indian Ocean to Egypt and Gaza. Egypt and
Gaza, indeed, are mentioned in Minæan inscriptions.<a id='r527'></a><a href='#f527' class='c013'><sup>[527]</sup></a> From
an early period the kingdoms of Southern Arabia had been in
commercial contact with Canaan.</p>

<p class='c003'>The conquest of Edom by David and the Hebrew fleets
which sailed from the Gulf of Aqaba must soon have
acquainted the merchant princes of Ma’ân and Saba with the
fact that a new power had risen in Western Asia, and a new
market been opened for their goods. The road to Palestine
was well-known and frequently travelled, and Minæan or
Sabæan settlements existed upon it almost as far as the
frontiers of Edom. What more natural, therefore, than that
a Sabæan queen should visit her wealthy neighbour whose
patronage had become important for Sabæan trade? That
queens might rule in the Arabian peninsula we know from the
annals of Tiglath-pileser <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr>, which refer to Zabibê and her
successor Samsê, each of whom is called a ‘queen of the land
of the Arabs.’</p>

<p class='c003'>Even the Pharaoh of Egypt condescended to mingle the
blood of the solar race with that of the grandson of a Hebrew
<span lang="hbo"><i>fellah</i></span>. Solomon married the daughter of the Egyptian
monarch. But it was a monarch of the twenty-first dynasty,
who, though acknowledged as the sole legitimate representative
of the line of the Sun-god Ra, had nevertheless been
sadly shorn of his ancient rights and authority. His power
was confined to the Delta, where he held his court in the
old Hyksos capital of Tanis or Zoan, close to the Asiatic
frontier, and as far removed as possible from the rival dynasty
which ruled in Upper Egypt. He was doubtless glad to
secure a son-in-law who could defend him from his enemies
at home in case of need, and whose friendship was preferable
to his hostility.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Egyptian princess had brought with her as dowry the
Canaanitish city of Gezer. That it should have been in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>power of the Pharaoh to give it is at first sight surprising.
It shows that Egypt had never relinquished in theory her old
claims to be mistress of Canaan. Like the title of ‘king of
France,’ which so long lingered in the royal style of England,
they were never abandoned, but were ready to be revived
whenever an opportunity occurred. Towards the close of the
period of the Judges, but before the Philistines had become
formidable, Assyria and Egypt had met on friendly terms on
the coast of Palestine. The Assyrian conqueror, Tiglath-pileser
<abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr> (in <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1100), had found his way to the Phœnician
city of Arvad, and there received from the Egyptian Pharaoh
various presents which included a crocodile and a hippopotamus.
The campaign of the Assyrian king had brought him
to the edge of the territory which the Egyptian rulers of the
twenty-first dynasty still regarded as their own, and they
hastened accordingly to propitiate the invader, and thus to
stay his further advance. The embassy and gifts further
show that the occupation of the coast by the Philistines did
not prevent the Egyptians from maintaining their old relations
with Phœnicia, though they may have done so by sea rather
than by land. At all events an expedition sent to Gebal by
Hir-Hor, the high priest of Thebes, at the beginning of the
twenty-first dynasty, was despatched in ships.<a id='r528'></a><a href='#f528' class='c013'><sup>[528]</sup></a> Had the coast-road
been free from danger, the Egyptians would doubtless
have asserted their right to march along it. They seized the
first occasion to do so, when the Philistines had been conquered
by David, and the successor of David was the
Pharaoh’s ally.</p>

<p class='c003'>Solomon engaged in no wars of his own. He was no
general himself, and it may be that he feared to intrust a
subject with an army. Joab had taught him how easily the
commander-in-chief might defy his master, Abner how readily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>he might betray him. In the list of officials given in the
Hebrew text, Benaiah indeed is stated to have been ‘over the
host’ (1 Kings <abbr title='four'>iv.</abbr> 4), but Benaiah was actually the commander
of the bodyguard, so that his command of the army
must have been merely nominal. Practically the army which
had played so large a part in the history of David had ceased
to exist. Hence it was that Rezon was able to establish an
independent kingdom in Damascus, and that when the Ten
Tribes revolted there was no army at hand with which to
suppress the rebellion. Hence, too, the curious fact that just
as Solomon sought the help of Hiram in fitting out his
merchant fleet in the Gulf of Aqaba, so also he sought the
help of the Egyptian king in subduing the one Canaanitish
city of importance which still preserved its freedom. Gezer
had maintained its Canaanitish continuity from the days
when as yet the Israelites had not entered Canaan, and the
mounds of Tel Jezer which mark its site must still conceal
beneath them the records of its early history. Doubtless the
Egyptian court was gratified at the arrangement with the
Hebrew king. It admitted the Egyptian claim of suzerainty
over Palestine, and admitted the right of its armies to march
along its roads. But the substantial advantages remained
with Solomon. He gained Gezer without either expense or
trouble, and at the same time he allied himself by marriage
with the oldest and most exclusive royal race in the Oriental
world. Like the kings of Mitanni in the age of the eighteenth
dynasty, the son-in-law of the Pharaoh was on a footing of
equality with the proudest princes of Asia.</p>

<p class='c003'>The alliance with Hiram was no less advantageous. Hiram
had done for Tyre what Solomon was doing for Jerusalem.
It has been conjectured that his father Abibal, or Abi-Baal,
was the founder of a dynasty; at all events the accession of
Hiram ushered in a new era for the Tyrian state. He
succeeded to the throne at the age of nineteen years, and
during his long reign of thirty-four years he raised Tyre to an
unprecedented height of prosperity and power, and rebuilt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>the city itself. The ancient ‘rock’ from which it had derived
its name was connected by an embankment with another rocky
islet close to it, and a new and splendid city was erected upon
the space thus won from the sea. Excellent harbours were
constructed, massive walls built round the city, and the
venerable temple of Melkarth restored from its foundations,
and decorated with all the sumptuous splendour of Phœnician
art.</p>

<p class='c003'>Tyre had always been famous for its sailors and its ships,
and its wealth is celebrated even in the letters of Tel el-Amarna.
But under Hiram its maritime trade underwent an
enormous development. The conquest of the Philistines by
David, and the consequent disappearance of piracy from the
eastern basin of the Mediterranean, were the immediate causes
of this. Tyrian ships could now venture into the bays and
havens of the Greek seas in quest of slaves, or the precious
purple-fish, and their merchants could make voyages in safety
as far as Tarshish. Riches poured into ‘the merchant-city,’
and Hiram had resources in abundance for his public
works.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Hebrew king was eager to follow the example of his
Tyrian neighbour. It was true that his subjects were neither
sailors nor traders; it was true, also, that the harbours on the
Mediterranean coast which the conquest of the Philistines
had added to his dominions were few and poor. But the
conquest of Edom had given him the entrance to the spice-lands
of Southern Arabia, and the gold-mines which recent
discovery has found in Central Africa.<a id='r529'></a><a href='#f529' class='c013'><sup>[529]</sup></a> An agreement was
therefore come to with Hiram which was to the profit of
both. Hiram gave Solomon sailors and boat-builders, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>well as the use of his Mediterranean ports; in return he
received from Solomon the right of using the harbours of
the Red Sea. While the products of Europe made their
way to Solomon through Tyre, the products of the south
passed to Hiram from the Edomite havens of Elath and
Ezion-geber.</p>

<p class='c003'>Hiram was useful to Solomon in yet another way. The
age of empire-building was over; the time had come to
create a capital which should be worthy of the empire. Like
Ramses <abbr title='the second'><span class='fss'>II.</span></abbr> of Egypt, Solomon made himself an imperishable
name as a builder. Jerusalem was strongly fortified; royal
palaces were erected; above all, a temple was raised to Yahveh
that vied in splendour with those of Phœnicia and the Nile.
But the architects and artisans had to be brought from the
dominions of the Tyrian king; the Israelites had been too
much barbarised by the long struggle for existence they had
had to wage for another Bezaleel to be born among them, as
in the days when they had but just quitted the cultured land
of the Delta. It is true that the master-artificer in bronze,
who designed the bronze-work of the temple, was a Hebrew on
his mother’s side, but he bore the Tyrian name of Hiram, and
his father was ‘a man of Tyre.’ Even for his carpenters and
masons Solomon was indebted to his Tyrian ally; it was only
the gangs of labourers driven to their forced work among the
forests and quarries of Lebanon that were levied by Hadoram
out of ‘Israel.’ The Israelites had become hewers of wood
and drawers of water for their king, and, as in the old days of
Egyptian bondage, 3300 taskmasters were employed in keeping
them to their work.<a id='r530'></a><a href='#f530' class='c013'><sup>[530]</sup></a> Like the architects, the skilled
artificers were lent by Hiram; from Hiram came also the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>logs of cedar and fir that were needed for the buildings at
Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c003'>In return Solomon provided his ally with wheat and oil.
The island-city was dependent on others for its corn; on the
rock of Tyre and on the barren crags of the opposite mainland
no wheat could be grown. Twenty cities of Galilee,
moreover, were ceded to Hiram. But for these Hiram had to
pay one hundred and twenty talents of gold; and in the end,
the wily Hebrew, like his forefather Jacob, had the best of the
bargain. When the Tyrian king came to inspect his new
territory, it ‘pleased him not.’ Solomon, in fact, had given
him what it was not worth his own while to keep.</p>

<p class='c003'>The royal palace was thirteen years in building. Attached
to it was the armoury, or House of the Forest of Lebanon as
it was called from the cedar used in its construction. Here
the three hundred shields and two hundred targets of gold
were stored, which were made for the bodyguard, and served
also as a reserve fund in case of need. The architecture of the
palace itself culminated, as in Persia, in the audience-chamber
with its throne of ivory overlaid with gold, and approached by
six steps which were guarded on either side by the images of
lions. Another palace was erected for the Egyptian queen;
like the palace of the king it was in the Upper City, close to
the spot on which the temple was destined to stand.</p>

<p class='c003'>The old palace of David, in the lower town or ‘City of
David,’ was deserted; as soon as the new buildings were completed
on Moriah, the king moved to them with his harîm
and court. The palace which had satisfied the simple tastes
of the father was no longer sufficient for the luxury and display
of the more cultured son. The ‘City of David’ was left
to the Jews and Benjamites; the court and the priesthood
settled above them by the side of the old Jebusite population,
which had been reduced to serfdom (1 Kings <abbr title='nine'>ix.</abbr> 20).
None but slaves and serfs might dwell where the monarch
lived surrounded by his armed bodyguard; the free Israelite
was confined to another quarter of the town.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>The palace was protected by a huge fortress called the
Millo, which was connected with the new walls of Jerusalem,
and begun as soon as the palace of the Egyptian princess had
been finished. Whether it stood on the eastern or western
side of the city is doubtful; the topography of pre-exilic
Jerusalem is unfortunately still involved in obscurity. The
pool of Siloam, and the identification of the Upper Gihon or
‘Spring’ with the Virgin’s Fountain, the only natural spring
of water in the immediate neighbourhood of the city, are
almost the only two points which can be fixed with certainty.
If the subterranean tunnel which conveys the water of the
Virgin’s Fountain to the pool of Siloam is the conduit made
by Hezekiah when he ‘stopped the upper water-course of
Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the
city of David’ (2 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-two'>xxxii.</abbr> 30), the west side will be that
which overlooks the Tyropœon valley, where the tunnel ends.
In this case the city of David, which is stated in 2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v.</abbr> 7
to have been on Mount Zion, will be the so-called southern
hill or ‘Ophel,’ which lies south of the Mosque of Omar, and
the Tyropœon valley will be the Valley of the Sons of Hinnom
so often referred to in the Old Testament. The Jerusalem
of the kings will thus have been, like most of the cities
of the ancient Oriental world, of no great size according to our
modern conceptions; its population will have been as closely
packed together as it is to-day in the native quarters of Cairo,
and the fortifications which surrounded it would not have
occupied too wide a circumference for a Jewish army to defend.
The Tyropœon valley is choked with the rubbish of ancient
Jerusalem to a depth of more than seventy feet; but under it
must lie the tombs of the kings of Judah. The recent
excavations of Dr. Bliss have thrown but little light on the
question, since the walls he has found seem mostly of a late
date; but if the rock-cut steps he has discovered north of the
pool of Siloam are really ‘the stairs that go down from the
city of David’ (Neh. <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 16), a striking verification will have
been given of the theory which sees in the southern hill the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>Zion of Scripture, and in the valley of ‘the Cheesemakers’
the gorge of the sons of Hinnom.<a id='r531'></a><a href='#f531' class='c013'><sup>[531]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The crown of all the building activity of Solomon was the
temple, even though it did not take so long to construct as
his own palace. Materials for it had already been accumulated
by David, and the architects and workmen came from
Tyre. It was built of large blocks of square stone, the edges
of which were probably bevelled as in early Phœnician work,
and the walls inside were covered with panels of cedar.
Walls and doors alike were profusely decorated with the
designs of Phœnician art. Cherubs and palms, lotus flowers
and pomegranates were depicted on them in the forms that
have been made familiar to us by the relics of ancient
Phœnician workmanship. The temple itself was of rectangular
shape, not unlike the chapel of King’s College at
Cambridge, and in front of it were two large courts, one of
which—the ‘inner’ or ‘upper’ court—stood on a higher level
than the other. The whole design, in fact, was purely
Phœnician; in form and ornamentation the building exactly
resembled the temples of Phœnicia. Like them, it must
have looked externally like a huge rectangular box, which
was further disfigured by chambers, in sets of three, being
built one over the other against the walls. The great temple
of Melkarth, which Hiram had just completed at Tyre, probably
served as the model for the temple of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c003'>The entrance was approached by steps, and consisted of a
porch, on either side of which were two lofty columns of
bronze, called Jachin and Boaz.<a id='r532'></a><a href='#f532' class='c013'><sup>[532]</sup></a> Similar columns were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>planted before the entrance of a Phœnician temple where
they symbolised the fertilising power of the Sun-god, and
Herodotos (<abbr title='two'>ii.</abbr> 44) states that the two which stood in front of
the temple at Tyre were made of gold and emerald glass.
Two similar columns of stone, though of small size, have been
found in the Temple of the Giants in the island of Gozo, one
of which still remains in its original place. In the outer
court was a bronze ‘sea’ or basin, thirty cubits in circumference,
and supported on twelve oxen. The ‘sea’ had been
imported into the West from Babylonia, where it similarly
stood in the court of a temple, and represented the <span lang="hbo"><i>apsu</i></span> or
‘watery abyss,’ out of which Chaldæan philosophy taught that
all things had been evolved. A Babylonian hymn which
describes the casting of a copper ‘sea’ for the temple of
Chaos tells us that, like the ‘sea’ at Jerusalem, it rested on the
heads of twelve bulls.<a id='r533'></a><a href='#f533' class='c013'><sup>[533]</sup></a> Along with the ‘sea’ bronze lavers
and basins were provided for the ablutions of the priests and
the vessels of the sanctuary.</p>

<p class='c003'>The temple was but a shell for enclosing the innermost
shrine or Holy of Holies where, as in a casket, the ark of the
covenant was placed under the protecting wings of two gilded
cherubim. What they were like we may gather from the
Assyrian sculptures, in which the two winged cherubs are
depicted on either side of the sacred tree.<a id='r534'></a><a href='#f534' class='c013'><sup>[534]</sup></a> The over-shadowing
wings formed a ‘mercy-seat,’ the <i>parakku</i> of the
Babylonian texts, whereon, according to Nebuchadrezzar, Bel
seated himself on the festival of the new year, while the other
gods humbly ranged themselves around him bowing to the
ground.<a id='r535'></a><a href='#f535' class='c013'><sup>[535]</sup></a> At Babylon, moreover, the table of shewbread
which stood before Bel was of solid gold, like the table which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>Solomon made for the service of Yahveh.<a id='r536'></a><a href='#f536' class='c013'><sup>[536]</sup></a> Indeed, the
description of the lavish use of gold in the temple of Jerusalem
finds its echo in the description given by Nebuchadrezzar
of the temples he reared in Babylon. The altar of
Yahveh, it is said, was of gold, so too were the candlesticks
and lamps and vessels; even the hinges of the doors that
opened into the Holy of Holies were of the same precious
metal, while the cedar work was richly gilded, and the floor
itself was overlaid with golden plates. In similar terms
Nebuchadrezzar describes his decoration of Ê-Sagila, the
temple of Bel, at Babylon. Here too, the beams and panels
of cedar were overlaid with gold, the gates were gilded, and
the vessels for the service of the sanctuary were of solid gold.<a id='r537'></a><a href='#f537' class='c013'><sup>[537]</sup></a>
There was one point, however, in which the temples of Jerusalem
and Babylon differed from one another; in the shrine
of Ê-Sagila was the image of Bel: the Hebrew shrine contained
no likeness of a god. The only graven figures within
it were the cherubim whose wings overshadowed the ark.</p>

<p class='c003'>The temple was finished in seven (or more exactly seven
and a half) years. Perhaps an effort was made to restrict the
years of building to the sacred number. At all events, it was
in the seventh month of the Hebrew year, the Ethanim of the
Phœnicians, that the feast of the dedication was kept.<a id='r538'></a><a href='#f538' class='c013'><sup>[538]</sup></a> It
coincided with the ancient festival of the Ingathering of the
Harvest, a fitting season for commemorating the completion
of the work.</p>

<p class='c003'>The dedication of Solomon’s temple is the beginning of a
new chapter in the history of the Jewish state and of Hebrew
religion. It became the visible centre round which the
elements of the Israelitish faith gathered and cohered together
until the terrible day came when the enemy stormed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>the walls of the capital and laid its temple in the dust. But
it had already exercised a profound influence upon the history
of Judah. It had helped to unify the kingdom; to bind the
population of southern Palestine, mixed in blood though it
were, into a single whole. Unlike the northern tribes with
their two great sanctuaries at Dan and Bethel, Judah and
Benjamin had a common centre in the one sanctuary of
Jerusalem. Around it, moreover, were grouped all the
traditions and memories of a venerable past. It alone was
connected with the traditions of the Mosaic Law and the
priesthood of Shiloh, with the rites and ceremonies that had
come down from the primeval days of the Israelitish people,
and with the foundation of the monarchy itself. It was the
dwelling-place on earth of Yahveh of Israel; here was the
sacred ark of the covenant which had once been carried
before the invaders of Canaan, and was still the outward sign
and symbol of God’s presence among His people. With the
preservation of the temple the preservation of the Jewish
religion itself seemed to be bound up, as well as of the Jewish
state.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the temple did something more than help to unify the
southern monarchy and preserve the traditions of the Mosaic
law. It served also to strengthen and perpetuate the Davidic
dynasty, and to keep alive in the hearts of the people their
allegiance to the line of Solomon. The temple, as we have
seen, was not only a national sanctuary, it was also a royal
chapel. It formed, as it were, part of the royal palace, in
which the king overshadowed the high priest himself. The
halo of veneration which surrounded the temple was thus
communicated to the royal line. The temple and the
descendants of David became parts of the same national
conception; the one necessarily implied the other. When
the throne of David fell, the temple also fell with it. While
the temple lasted, Judah remained a homogeneous state,
yielding willing obedience to its theocratic monarchy, and
gradually gaining a clearer idea of the meaning and practice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>of the Mosaic Law. The temple of Solomon made Jewish
religion conservative, but it was a conservatism which, as
time went on, evolved the consequences of its own principles,
and sought how best to carry them out in ritual and
practice.</p>

<p class='c003'>Jerusalem had become one of the great capitals of the
world. Its public buildings were worthy of the empire which
had been created by David, of the wealth that had poured
into the coffers of Solomon from the trade of the whole
Orient, of the culture and art which the young king had done
his best to introduce. But the necessities of defence were
not forgotten. The fortifications of the city were pushed on—though,
it would seem, not with sufficient rapidity to allow
them to be finished before the king’s death—and horses and
chariots were imported from Egypt and the land of the
Hittites in the north. With these Solomon equipped a
standing force of 1400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, who
served as garrisons in Jerusalem and the other fortresses of
the country.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nor were the other cities of the empire neglected in favour
of Jerusalem. Gezer was rebuilt and fortified; so too were
‘Beth-horon the nether and Baalath’ in Judah, and ‘Tadmor
in the wilderness,’ the Palmyra of later days.<a id='r539'></a><a href='#f539' class='c013'><sup>[539]</sup></a> It is true that
modern criticism would see in Tadmor the Tamar of the
southern desert of Judah which is referred to by Ezekiel
(<abbr title='forty-seven'>xlvii.</abbr> 19, <abbr title='forty-eight'>xlviii.</abbr> 28) as a future border of the Holy Land.
But, though the Kethîbh or text of the Hebrew Scriptures has
Tamar, the reading is corrupt, and has been corrected by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>Massoretic scribes themselves.<a id='r540'></a><a href='#f540' class='c013'><sup>[540]</sup></a> The Chronicler (2 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr>
<abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 4) shows that Tadmor was the reading of the text in his
time, and he shows further that it was known to be the
desert-city which afterwards became the seat of empire of
the merchant prince Odenathus and his queen, Zenobia.
We learn from him that Solomon had put down a rising in
that part of Zobah which adjoined Hamath, that he had
founded ‘store-cities’ in Hamath, and had built Tadmor in
the wilderness beyond. It is strange only that no allusion
is made to building operations in Israel: perhaps Solomon
was disinclined to establish fortresses among the northern
tribes which might be used against his own authority,
perhaps David had already put the cities of northern Israel in
a thorough state of defence. At all events, little danger from
abroad was to be apprehended in this part of the Israelitish
dominions; Solomon was in alliance with Tyre, and presumably
also with Hamath, and Zobah was included in his
empire.</p>

<p class='c003'>We gather from the Assyrian inscriptions that Zobah extended
from the neighbourhood of Hamath and Damascus
eastward across the desert towards the Euphrates. Midway
stood Palmyra, approached by roads from both Damascus and
Homs, which there united and then led to the ford across
the Euphrates at Thapsacus or Tiphsakh. It was the shortest
route from Palestine to Mesopotamia, and avoided the tolls
and possible hostility of the Hittites in their strong fortress of
Carchemish. The conquest of Zobah would necessarily have
laid Palmyra and the roads that passed through it at the feet
of David, and the importance of the place for commercial
purposes could not have failed to strike the mind of Solomon
ever ready to discover fresh channels of trade. Its fortification
would naturally have been one of his first cares; even if
there had been no mention of the fact in the Old Testament,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>the historian would have been almost compelled to assume it.
It opened to him the merchandise of Mesopotamia, of
Babylonia, and Assyria, and brought him into touch with the
old monarchies of the Asiatic world. For the trade of the
east, Palmyra was to Solomon what the ports of Edom were
for the trade of the south.</p>

<p class='c003'>To the north his dominions touched on those of the
Hittites, who were still settled in Kadesh on the Orontes,
even if Hamath had long since passed out of their possession.
Lenormant was the first to point out that in 1 Kings <abbr title='ten'>x.</abbr> 28
there is an allusion to the importation of horses into Judah,
not only from Egypt, but also from the Hittite regions on the
Gulf of Antioch. Here lived the Quê of the Assyrian
monuments, who are named in the Hebrew text, though it
needed the revelations of Oriental archæology to discover the
fact. Solomon, it is there said, ‘had horses brought out of
Egypt and out of Quê; the royal merchants received it from
Quê at a price.’ In the later days of the Assyrian empire
Nineveh obtained its supply of horses and stallions from the
same part of the world, and there are numerous letters to the
king which relate to their importation. The chariots came
from Egypt, the value of each being as much as 600 shekels
of silver, or £90; it was only the horses that were brought
from ‘the kings of the Hittites’ and ‘the kings of Aram.’
The trade in both horses and chariots was a monopoly which
Solomon kept jealously in his own hands; the merchants
were those ‘of the king,’ and none of his subjects was allowed
to import materials of war which might be employed against
himself.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was the trade with the south which introduced into
Jerusalem the greatest novelties and the most costly articles
of luxury. In imitation of the kings of Egypt and Assyria,
Solomon established zoological and botanical gardens where
the strange animals and plants that had been brought from
abroad were kept. Such collections had been made by
Thothmes <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> at Thebes, and on the foundations of a ruined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>chamber in his temple at Karnak we may still see pictures of
the trees and plants and birds which he sent home from his
campaigns in Syria and the Soudan. In Assyria a botanical
garden had been similarly planted by Tiglath-pileser <abbr title='the first'><span class='fss'>I.</span></abbr>
(<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1100), and stocked with foreign plants.<a id='r541'></a><a href='#f541' class='c013'><sup>[541]</sup></a> Solomon’s collections
were therefore no new thing in the Oriental world,
though they were a novelty in Palestine; and his subjects
went to gaze and wonder, like the Cairenes of to-day, at the
apes which had come from the far south, or the peacocks
whose name (<span lang="hbo"><i>thukîyîm</i></span>) betrayed their Indian origin. It is
even said that he composed books on the animal and vegetable
collections he had made.<a id='r542'></a><a href='#f542' class='c013'><sup>[542]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Gold and silver and ivory were also brought, with the apes
and peacocks, by the merchant vessels whose voyages of three
years’ duration carried them along the Somali coast, and
even, it may be, to the mouths of the Indus. The gold
probably came, for the most part, from the mines of the
Zambesi region, where foreign mining settlements are now
known to have been established at an early date, and where
objects have been found, such as birds carved out of stone,
which remind us of the civilisation of southern Arabia. But
the greater part of the silver, which we are told became as
plentiful as ‘stones,’ must have been derived from Asia
Minor. Here were the mines from which the Hittites extracted
the metal for which they seem to have had a special
fancy, and it was through them that it probably made its way
to Jerusalem. Copper would have come from Cyprus, and
been brought in the ships which trafficked in the Mediterranean.
It was the Mediterranean trade, moreover, which supplied the
tin needed for the vast quantities of bronze that was used in
the Solomonic age. We know of no source of it equal to
such a demand except the peninsula of Cornwall; but if it
really was Cornish tin that found its way to the eastern basin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>of the Mediterranean during the Bronze Age it must have
travelled like amber across Europe until it reached the
Adriatic or the Gulf of Lyons. The amber found by Dr.
Schliemann in the prehistoric tombs of Mykenæ is of Baltic
origin, and amber beads have been discovered by Dr. Bliss at
Lachish, belonging to the century before the Exodus; if
amber could travel thus far from northern Europe, the tin
might have done the same.</p>

<p class='c003'>Future generations looked back upon the reign of Solomon
as the golden age of Israel. But there was a reverse side to
the picture. The combination of culture and arbitrary power
produced in him the selfish luxury of an Oriental despot,
which is bent on satisfying its own sensuous desires at the
expense of all around it. Solomon’s extravagance was like
that of the Khedive Ismail in our own day, and it led to the
same amount of misery and impoverishment in the nation.
He found on his accession a treasury well filled by the
thrifty government of his father; and his trading monopolies
and alliances brought him an apparently inexhaustible supply
of wealth. But a time came when even this supply began to
fail, and to cease to suffice for his reckless expenditure.
Heavier taxes were laid on the subject populations; the free
men of Israel were compelled to work as unpaid serfs under
the lash of the taskmaster, and the older population of the
land, who were still numerous, were turned into veritable
bond-slaves. To the Gibeonites, who had long been the
serfs of the Levitical sanctuary, were now added the Nethinim,
a part of whom went under the name of ‘Solomon’s slaves’
(Ezra <abbr title='two'>ii.</abbr> 55, 58). The building of the temple had cost the
people dear: the Israelites had been robbed of their freedom
to provide for it stone and wood; the Canaanites had been
given to it as actual slaves.</p>

<p class='c003'>Doubtless the policy of Solomon was partly determined by
the same considerations as those which had moved the
Pharaoh of the Oppression. He mistrusted the Canaanites,
he was afraid of the northern tribes. In either case he
endeavoured to break their spirit, and render them powerless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>to revolt. But in the case of the Hebrew tribesmen he did
not succeed. Discontent was smothered for awhile, but it
was none the less dangerous on that account. And towards
the end of Solomon’s life an incident occurred which led
eventually to the division of the kingdom. Jeroboam the
son of Nebat—in whom Dr. Neubauer has seen the name of
a ‘Nabathean’—and whose mother belonged to the tribe of
Ephraim, had distinguished himself by his activity and
abilities. Solomon had finished the Millo or Fort, and was
now at work on the other fortifications of Jerusalem. His
notice was drawn to Jeroboam, and he made the young man
the ‘taskmaster’ or overseer of the <i>corvée</i> of Ephraimites
employed upon the walls. Like Moses in old days, Jeroboam’s
sympathy was aroused by the sufferings of his fellow-tribesmen,
which found a mouthpiece in Ahijah the prophet
of Shiloh. Ahijah was himself one of the dispossessed. The
glory of Shiloh had passed away from it; Jerusalem had taken
its place. The tabernacle of Shiloh had been rejected in
favour of the temple of the Jewish king. The centre of
Hebrew religion and power had departed from the house of
Joseph, and been transferred to the mixed parvenus of Judah.</p>

<p class='c003'>In Jeroboam the prophet recognised the leader who should
restore the lost fortunes of Ephraim and revenge its injuries.
Jeroboam listened to the counsels of revolt, but the time for
making use of them had not yet come. His plans and
plotting became known to Solomon, and, once more like
Moses, he had to fly for his life. He made his way to the
Egyptian court, where a ready welcome awaited him.</p>

<p class='c003'>A new dynasty had arisen there. The Libyan mercenaries
had dethroned their feeble masters, and seated Shishak or
Sheshanq, their general, upon the throne of the Pharaohs.
The Tanitic dynasty which ruled the Delta was swept away;
so also was the rival dynasty of high-priests who reigned at
Thebes and held possession of Upper Egypt. With the
rise of the twenty-second dynasty at Bubastis, a new and
unaccustomed vigour was infused into the government of
Egypt. Shishak proved himself an able and energetic king.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>His earlier years were occupied in putting down opposition
at home, and restoring order and unity throughout the country.
When once the task was accomplished, he began to turn
his attention elsewhere. Egypt had never relinquished its
theoretical claims to sovereignty in Canaan; and the new
power that had arisen there menaced the safety of the Asiatic
frontier. Solomon, it is true, had allied himself by marriage
with the Pharaohs; but it was with a Pharaoh of the fallen
dynasty, and this in itself made him all the more dangerous
a neighbour. At present Israel was too powerful to be
attacked; but a time might come when the Egyptian monarch
might venture to march again along the roads that had once
conducted the armies of Egypt to the conquest of Syria.
Meanwhile Shishak could stir up disaffection and rebellion
in the Israelitish empire, and could harbour pretenders to
the throne who might hereafter undermine the very existence
of the new power.</p>

<p class='c003'>As long as Solomon lived Jeroboam did not dare to stir.
But he was not the only ‘adversary’ of the Jewish king.
Hadad, the representative of the old kings of Edom, had also
found a refuge in the Egyptian court, and had there married
the sister-in-law of the Pharaoh. In spite of the Pharaoh’s
remonstrances he had returned to the mountains of Edom
when David and Joab were dead, and had there carried on a
guerilla warfare with the Israelitish garrisons. Throughout
the lifetime of Solomon he had maintained himself in the
fastnesses of Seir, and had been, as it were, a thorn in the
side of the conquerors of his country. But he never succeeded
in seriously injuring the caravan trade that passed through
Edom, or in shaking off the Israelitish yoke. The male
population of Edom had been too mercilessly exterminated
for this to be possible, and all that he could do was to molest
the trade with the Red Sea. But even in this he does not
seem to have been successful.</p>

<p class='c003'>A more formidable opponent of Israel was Rezon of Zobah.
He, it would seem, had established himself at Damascus even
before the death of David, and all the efforts to dislodge him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>were of no avail. It is possible that the insurrection in Zobah,
which led to the construction of fortified posts on the borders
of Hamath (2 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 3), was connected with his revolt.
At any rate, Rezon founded a kingdom and a dynasty in the
old Syrian capital, which in years to come was to shake the
monarchy of northern Israel to its base. ‘He abhorred Israel,’
we are told, ‘and reigned over Aram.’</p>

<p class='c003'>The Jewish historian traces the misfortunes of Solomon to
the religious indifferentism of his later years. His wives were
many, his concubines innumerable. They had been added
to his harîm from all parts of the known world; and they
brought with them the worship of their native deities.
Solomon had none of that intense belief in the national
God which had distinguished Saul and David, or which
made the Assyrian kings conquer and slay the unbelievers
who would not acknowledge the supremacy of Assur.<a id='r543'></a><a href='#f543' class='c013'><sup>[543]</sup></a> He
was a cultured and selfish epicure, catholic in his tastes and
sympathies, and doubtless inclined to stigmatise as narrow-minded
fanaticism the objections of those who would have
forbidden him to indulge his wives in their religious beliefs.
On the hill opposite Jerusalem they were allowed to worship in
the chapels of their own divinities, and the king himself did not
refuse to bow himself with them in the house of Rimmon.
Shrines were erected and altars blazed to Ashtoreth of the
Sidonians, to Milcom of Ammon, and to Chemosh of Moab.</p>

<p class='c003'>Modern criticism has averred that all this was only in
accordance with the general ideas and practice of the time,
and that not Solomon alone but the rest of his people saw
little or no difference between Yahveh and Baal. The Song
of Deborah, which reflects the feelings of so much earlier
an epoch, is a sufficient answer to such an assertion. The
whole history of Saul and David points unmistakably to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>contrary, and the temple bears witness that there was a time
when Solomon also shared the belief that Yahveh alone was
God in Israel, and that He would brook the presence of no
other god beside Himself. The character of Solomon, his
habits and alliances,—above all, the seductions of the harîm,
are quite enough to account for a gradual change in his views.
It is probable, moreover, that the death of his old guide and
instructor Nathan may have had much to do with what an
undogmatic theology might call emancipation from the narrow
and exclusive circle of Hebrew religious ideas; we know that
such was the case with Jehoash after the death of Jehoiada the
priest. The king who began by sending to Phœnicia for the
architects and builders of the temple, ended not unnaturally
with the erection of sanctuaries to a Phœnician goddess.</p>

<p class='c003'>In fact, the artistic tastes of Solomon ran counter to the
puritanical tendencies and restrictions of the Mosaic Law. It
had been made for the wanderers in the desert, for hardy
warriors intent on the conquest of a foreign land, for the
simple peasantry of Palestine. It was directed against the
cultured vices and artistic idolatries of Egypt and Canaan:
on its forefront was the command: ‘Thou shalt not make
the likeness of anything that is in the heaven above, in the
earth beneath, or in the water that is under the earth.’ The
temple at Jerusalem, with its costly decoration and graven
images, was in itself a violation of the letter of the Law.
Solomon was called indeed to be king over Israel, but his
heart and his sympathies were with Phœnicia.</p>

<p class='c003'>He had been carefully educated, and, like our own
Henry <abbr title='the eighth'><span class='fss'>VIII.</span></abbr>, was a learned as well as a cultivated prince.
His wisdom was celebrated above that of the wisest men of
his day (1 Kings <abbr title='four'>iv.</abbr> 30, 31), and he left behind him a large
collection of proverbs. Some of these were re-edited by the
scribes of Hezekiah’s library (<abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-five'>xxv.</abbr> 1), the foundation of
which may possibly go back to him. Indeed, he showed
himself so anxious to imitate the civilised monarchs of his
day that it is hard to believe he established no library at
Jerusalem. The library had been for untold centuries as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>essential to the royal dignity in Western Asia or Egypt as
the temple or palace, and the annals of Menander imply
that one existed at Tyre in the age of Hiram. Archæology
has vindicated the authenticity of the letters that passed
between Solomon and the Tyrian king (2 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii.</abbr> 3, 11);
similar letters were written in Babylonia in the age of
Abraham, and the tablets of Tel el-Amarna have demonstrated
how frequent they were in the ancient East. As in
Babylonia and Assyria, so, too, in Palestine, they would have
been preserved among the archives of the royal library.</p>

<p class='c003'>Hiram was nineteen years old when he ascended the
throne, and he died at the age of fifty-three. Solomon was
probably of about the same age as his friend both at his
accession and at his death. He died, worn out by excessive
self-indulgence, leaving behind him an impoverished treasury,
a discontented people, and a tottering empire. But he had
achieved one great result. Jerusalem had become the capital
of a united Judah and Benjamin, Hebrew religion had
obtained a local habitation round which henceforward it
could live and grow, and the dynasty of David was planted
firmly on the Jewish throne. When the disruption of the
kingdom came after Solomon’s death, it did no more than
give outward form to the estrangement that had so long been
maturing between Judah and the northern tribes; the temple,
the line of David, and the fortress-capital of Jerusalem
remained unshaken. The work of David and Solomon was
accomplished, though in a way of which they had not
dreamed; and a nation was called into existence whom
neither defeat nor exile, persecution nor contempt, has ever
been able to destroy.</p>

of Elam, is called a ‘Khabirâ’ (<abbr class='spell'>W. A. I.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv.</abbr> 34, 2, 5). The name is probably
connected with that of Khapir or Âpir, originally applied to the
district in which Mal-Amir is situated, south-east of Susa, but afterwards
in the Persian period extended to the whole of Elam (see my memoir on
the <i>Inscriptions of Mal-Amir</i> in the Transactions of the Sixth Oriental
Congress at Leyden, <abbr title='volume'>vol.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii.</abbr>). Kharbi-Sipak himself, however, seems to
have been employed by the Assyrian king in Palestine in the neighbourhood
of the cities of Arqa and Zaqqal (Hommel in the <i>Proceedings</i> of the
Society of Biblical Archæology, May 1895, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 203).</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='label'><a href='#r12'>12</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>An inscription of Sargon recently published by <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Dangin (<span lang="fr"><i>Revue
Sémitique</i></span>, April 1897) states that ‘the governor’ of the subjugated
Amorites was Uru-Malik, where the name of Malik or Moloch is preceded
by the determinative of divinity. Uru-Malik, which is an analogous
formation to Uriel, Urijah, Melchi-ur (or Melchior), etc., shows that what
we call Hebrew was already the language of Canaan. The inscription
has been found at Tello in Southern Chaldæa.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='label'><a href='#r14'>14</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>We possess a list of the kings of Babylonia, divided into dynasties,
from the first dynasty of Babylon, to which Khammu-rabi belonged, down
to the time of the fall of Nineveh. The number of years reigned by each
king is stated, as well as the number of years each dynasty lasted. But,
unfortunately, the compiler has forgotten to say what was the duration of
the dynasty to which Nabonassar (<abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 747) belonged; and as the tablet is
broken here, the regnal years of most of the kings who formed the dynasty
have been lost. There are, however, a good many synchronisms between
the earlier period of Babylonian history and that of Assyria, and by means
of these the chronology has been approximately restored. We can also
test the date of Khammu-rabi in the following way. We learn from
Assur-bani-pal that Kudur-Nankhundi, king of Elam, carried off the image
of the goddess Nana from the city of Erech 1635 years before his own
conquest of Elam, and therefore 2280 <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> As Eri-Aku boasts of his
capture of Erech, and as he was assisted in his wars by his Elamite kinsmen,
it seems probable that the capture of the image by Kudur-Nankhundi
was coincident with the capture of the city by Eri-Aku.</p>

<p class='c003'>The discovery of Mr. Pinches has been supplemented by that of Dr.
Scheil, who has found letters addressed by Khammu-rabi to Sin-idinnam
of Larsa, in which mention is made of the Elamite king Kudur-Laghghamar.
Sin-idinnam had been driven from Larsa by Eri-Aku with the
help of Kudur-Laghghamar, and had taken refuge at the court of Khammu-rabi
in Babylon. Fragments of other letters of Khammu-rabi are in the
possession of Lord Amherst of Hackney (see <abbr title='infra'><i>inf.</i></abbr> <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 27, 28).</p>

the final syllable of Amraphel is the Babylonian <i>ilu</i>, ‘god,’ a title which is

day (of the defeat) of Kudur-Laghghamar. If (the enemy) trouble you,
destroy their forces with the troops at your disposal, and let the images

impose upon them any additional task, but oblige them to do what they
ought to have done, and then remove them from the influence of him who

“Mighty King” cannot possibly be the Pharaoh.’ But he seems to me to
introduce an unnecessary element of complication into the subject by
supposing that in the Tel el-Amarna letters the epithet has been transferred
to the king of the Hittites from the supreme god of Jerusalem, to whom it
properly belonged. It is true that in a letter of the governor of Phœnicia
(Winckler und Abel, <abbr title='Number'>No.</abbr> 76, <abbr title='line'>l.</abbr> 66) the title is given to the king of the
Hittites, but it does not follow that the king of Jerusalem employs it in

<p class='c003'><span class='label'><a href='#r43'>43</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>A brilliant suggestion of Professor Hommel, however, may prove to
be the true explanation of the mysterious name. In the Minæan inscriptions
of Southern Arabia a long <abbr class='spell'><i>â</i></abbr> is constantly denoted in writing by <abbr class='spell'><i>h</i></abbr>;
and Abraham, therefore, may be merely the Minæan mode of writing
Abram. If so, this would show that the Hebrew scribes were once under
the influence of the Minæan script, and that portions of the Pentateuch
itself may have been written in the letters of the Minæan alphabet
(Hommel, <i>The Ancient Hebrew Tradition</i>, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 275-277). Dr. Neubauer
has suggested to me that this also may be the explanation of the name of
Aaron (<i>Aharôn</i>), which, like Ab-raham, has no etymology. Aaron would
be the graphic form of Âron, an Arabic name which appears as Aran in
the genealogy of the Horites (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-six'>xxxvi.</abbr> 28).</p>

the king of the country, who was afterwards deified in the planet Saturn,
had an only son by a nymph of the country called Anôbret. This son
was named Yeud, which signifies in Phœnician an only son. His country
having fallen into distress during a war, Kronos clothed his son in royal
robes, raised an altar, and sacrificed him upon it.’ In his account of
the Phœnician mythology, the same writer describes the sacrifice a little
differently: ‘A plague and a famine having occurred, Kronos sacrificed
his only son to his father the Sky, circumcised himself, and obliged his
companions to do the same’ (Euseb. <abbr class='spell'><i>l. c.</i></abbr>).</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='label'><a href='#r88'>88</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>According to immemorial tradition, the site of the field is marked by
Jacob’s Well (<abbr title='Saint'>S.</abbr> John <abbr title='four'>iv.</abbr> 6). Dr. Masterman in the <i>Quarterly Statement</i>
of the Palestine Exploration Fund, April 1897, gives for the first time a
satisfactory explanation why this deep well, which is often dry in summer,
should have been sunk in the neighbourhood of a number of springs:—‘The
springs have probably always belonged to the townsfolk (since they
became settled); and, in the case of any wandering tribes with considerable
flocks among them, it is exceedingly probable that the more settled
inhabitants would first resent and then resist the new-comers marching
twice daily into their midst to water their flocks at their springs, Probably
any experienced nomad with such flocks, accustomed to such a
country as this, would know pretty surely where he might, from the conformation
of the hills, expect to find water. If, then, a quarrel arose, what
more probable than that he should seek to make himself independent of
these disagreeable neighbours. Further, if we can accept the tradition,
we have, in the story of Jacob, two special facts connected with this:
firstly, he bought a piece of ground on which he could make a well for
himself; and then we gather from Genesis <abbr title='thirty-four'>xxxiv.</abbr> that his family made
themselves sufficiently obnoxious to the Shechemites to make it very
necessary for Jacob to be independent of their permission to use their
springs.’</p>

Aleppo. The name of the Jews is written in the same way in the cuneiform
texts, though the Yaudu of the Tel el-Amarna tablets are probably
to be identified with the land of Ya’di, which the inscriptions of Sinjerli
place in Northern Syria. But it is noticeable that the Tel el-Amarna
correspondence makes Kinza a district near Kadesh on the Orontes, close
to the Lake of Homs, and Kinza is letter for letter the Biblical Kenaz.
The Kenizzites, it will be remembered, formed an integral part of the later

<p class='c003'><span class='label'><a href='#r128'>128</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>The theory of Jean Astruc, the French Protestant physician, was set
forth in his <span lang="fr"><i>Conjectures sur la Genèse</i></span> published anonymously at Paris in
1753. In this he assumes that Moses wrote the book of Genesis in four
parallel columns like a Harmony of the Gospels which were afterwards
mixed together by the ignorance of copyists. Astruc intended his work
to be an answer to those who, like Spinoza, asserted that Genesis was
written without order or plan. It is interesting to note that Dr. Briggs in
his able defence of the ‘critical’ hypothesis (<i>The Higher Criticism of the
Hexateuch</i>, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 138-141) quotes with approval Professor Moore’s appeal to
Tatian’s <i>Diatessaron</i>—a mere ‘patchwork’ of the Gospels—in support of
the literary analysis of the Pentateuch.</p>

<abbr title='eleven'>xi</abbr>-<abbr title='thirteen'>xiii</abbr>; also <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <abbr title='seven'>vii</abbr>, where he says: ‘The argument from language outside
the divine names requires extreme care for obvious reasons. It is admitted
to be relatively weak, and can never have more than a subordinate and
supplementary value. There is no visible cleavage line among the
supposed sources.’ Professor Bissell’s work is an attempt to represent by
different colours the text of Genesis as it has been analysed and disintegrated
by the ‘higher critics,’ and the result at which he arrives in his
Introduction is that the analytical theory is a house built upon sand. As
regards the account of the Flood, in which ‘it is claimed’ that two distinct
narratives can be distinguished from each other, he remarks: ‘Two
flood-stories, originating, according to the theory, hundreds of years apart,
and literally swarming with differences and contradictions ... are found
to fit one another like so many serrated blocks, and to form, united, a
consecutive history whose unity, with constant use for millenniums, has
been undisputed till our day. Is this coincidence, or is it miracle? But let
us take a closer look. We shall find no loosely joined, independent sections,
but mutually dependent parts of one whole. An occasional overlapping
of ideas, a repetition for emphasis, or enlargement, in complete
harmony with Hebrew style, there undoubtedly is. But there is also a
marked interdependence and sequence of thought wholly inconsistent with
the theory proposed. Let the reader test what <abbr class='spell'>J</abbr>’s story would be alone.
Beginning it has none; no preliminary announcement of the catastrophe;
no command to make preparations; no report of Noah’s attitude.... And
so <abbr class='spell'>P</abbr>’s story, taken by itself, would be equally incomplete.... As to the
alleged discrepancies in other respects, they appear, as we have seen, to be
true in other cases, only after the text is rent asunder. The lighting
system of the one does not exclude the one window of the other; nor the
covering for the roof, the door in the side. Without the door, for which
one document alone is responsible, how is it supposed that the occupants
of the ark got in and out of it? If objects are thrown out of their due
perspective, as in a mirage, it need surprise no one if they appear distorted
and grotesque.... It is particularly in the matter of language and style
that resort is taken to this illogical and dangerous means of text-mutilation.
There are certain stylistic peculiarities of one or the other document, it is
claimed, which are fixed from the usage of previous chapters. But unfortunately
for the scheme, they appear not unfrequently in the wrong place.
For instance, the expression “male and female” is held to be characteristic
of <abbr class='spell'>P, J</abbr> using another for it. In <abbr title='seven'>vii.</abbr> 3, 9, <abbr class='spell'>J</abbr> uses this expression twice, and
our critics must make the redactor deny it. The oft-recurring formula,
“both man, beast, and creeping thing and fowl of the air,” is found in the
first chapter of Genesis, and so is said to be characteristic of <abbr class='spell'>P</abbr>. Here <abbr class='spell'>J</abbr>
has it in <abbr title='six'>vi.</abbr> 7 and <abbr title='seven'>vii.</abbr> 23, and the redactor is called in to square the document
to the theory.... In all these changes we are supposed to have the
work of a redactor. How is it possible? What motive could a redactor
have had for it? It is claimed by our critics that he has left the principal
points of contrast between the two great documents from which he compiled
in their original ruggedness. The principal changes made, with rare
exceptions, are of single words, detached phrases, verses or parts of verses,—every
one of them changes in what was originally homogeneous matter to
what is now heterogeneous, from what was once true, from the point of
view of the document, to what is now false!’</p>

described as ‘him that dwelt in the <span lang="hbo"><i>seneh</i></span>.’ The <span lang="hbo"><i>seneh</i></span> was probably the

<p class='c003'><span class='label'><a href='#r165'>165</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>No satisfactory etymology of the name Yahveh has yet been found.
This, however, is not strange, considering that the etymology was unknown
to the Hebrews themselves, as is shown by the explanation of the
name in <abbr title='Exodus'>Exod.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii.</abbr> 14, where it is derived from the Aramaic <i>hewâ</i>, the
Hebrew equivalent being <span lang="hbo"><i>hâyâh</i></span>, with <abbr class='spell'><i>y</i></abbr> instead of <abbr class='spell'><i>w</i></abbr> (or <abbr class='spell'><i>v</i></abbr>). The Babylonians
were also ignorant of the original meaning of the word, since one
of the lexical cuneiform tablets gives <i>Yahu</i> or Yahveh as meaning ‘god’
(in Israelitish), and identifies it with the Assyrian word <i>yahu</i>, ‘myself’
(83, 1-18, 1332 <abbr title='Obverse'><i>Obv.</i></abbr>; <abbr title='column'>Col.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii.</abbr> 1). No certain traces of the name have been
found except among the Israelites. It is a verbal formation like <i>Jacob</i>,
<i>Joseph</i>, etc.</p>

the river would affect the canals and such pools and ponds as were fed from

for cattle for the sake of the foreigners. It had been abandoned since the
time of (our) ancestors. All the kings of Upper Egypt sat within their
entrenchments ... and the kings of Lower Egypt found themselves in
the midst of their cities, surrounded with earthworks, cut off from everything
by the (hostile) warriors, for they had no mercenaries to oppose to
them. Thus had it been [until Meneptah] ascended the throne of Horus.
He was crowned to preserve the life of mankind.’ The word translated
‘tents’ is <i>ahilu</i>, the Hebrew <span lang="hbo"><i>ôhêl</i></span>, which is used by Ramses <abbr title='the third'><span class='fss'>III.</span></abbr> of the

states that ‘many historians’ had described it. Arrian (<abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 27) alludes to
it, and Menander introduced a scoffing reference to the miracle in one
of his plays. The actual facts are given by Strabo (<i>Geog.</i> <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 3, 9), who
says that near Phasêlis Mount Klimax juts out into the sea, but that in
calm weather a road runs round its base on the seaward side. If the
wind rises, however, the road is submerged by the waves. Alexander
ventured to march along it while still covered by the sea, and though the
water was up to the waists of the soldiers, passed safely through it, the
wind not being very strong. His success came to be regarded as a miracle,
and the miraculous passage of the sea by his army is narrated with many
embellishments in the fragment of an unknown historian in a lexicon

in a ship of Arvad, and of there killing a dolphin, while his son,

(<abbr class='spell'>W. A. I.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i.</abbr> 6, <abbr title='Number'>No.</abbr> <abbr title='six'>vi.</abbr>). A little later Assur-irbi carved an image of himself
on Mount Amanus, near the Gulf of Antioch, but the capture by the king of
Aram of Mutkina, which guarded the ford over the Euphrates, subsequently
cut him off from the west. Palestine is already called Ebir-nâri, ‘the land
beyond the river,’ in an Assyrian inscription which Professor Hommel

23, 24, and sees in it a reference to the kingdom of Samalla, to the north-east
of the Gulf of Antioch. The two verses become in his translation,
‘[And he saw Samalla], and began his speech, and said, Alas, who will
survive of Samalla? And ships [shall come] from the coast of Chittim,
and Asshur shall oppress him, and Eber shall oppress him, and he himself
is destined to destruction.’ Samalla, however, was only the Assyrian
name of a district called by natives of Northern Syria Ya’di and
Gurgum; nor is it easy to understand how Balaam could have ‘seen’ the
north of Syria from Moab. Professor Hommel is more probably right
in his view that Asshur here does not signify the Assyrians, but the
Asshurim to the south of Palestine (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-five'>xxv.</abbr> 3, 18).</p>

perhaps infer that the older reading of the Hebrew text was Yeho-ham.
If so, we should have an example of the use of the name of the national
God of Israel among the Hebronites. The substitution of El for Yeho
would be parallel to the fact that in the inscriptions of the Assyrian king
Sargon the contemporary king of Hamath is called both Yahu-bihdi and
Ilu-bihdi. <abbr class='spell'>Cf.</abbr> also Joram and Hado-ram (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 10; 1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='eighteen'>xviii.</abbr>

by the Philistines before they left Krete, if indeed they came from that

by a stratagem similar to that which we read of in the story of Ali Baba
and the Forty Thieves. But from the point of view of history alone there
is no reason for discrediting the narrative. Bedâwin superstition would
fully account for the panic and flight if the camp believed that the spirits

But such a momentous disaster could not fail to become known throughout
Canaan, and some notice of it must have been taken by the chroniclers
of Ephraim themselves. Where and by whom, however, the present
account was composed it is vain to inquire, and the question may be left

himself. It has been gravely maintained that there were only three priests
at Shiloh at the time, because nothing is said about any others; had the

<abbr title='Deuteronomy'>Deut.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-three'>xxiii.</abbr> 17, 18). But the fact that the intercourse of the sons of Eli
with them was a sin in the eyes of both Yahveh and the people proves the
contrary. Here, as in other cases, an old institution of Semitic religion was
retained among the adherents of the Mosaic law, but it was deprived of
its pagan and immoral characteristics.</p>

as, for example, by Professor Cornill, <i>The Prophets of Israel</i>, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 8-10, where
it is erroneously stated that the Babylonian <i>nabû</i> does not mean ‘to pronounce’
or ‘proclaim.’ The name of Nebo shows to what antiquity the
Babylonian <i>nabium</i> in its special sense of ‘prophet’ reaches back. The
modern Arabic <i>nebi</i> is borrowed from the Hebrew <span lang="hbo"><i>nâbî</i></span>. <span lang="hbo"><i>Nâbî</i></span> corresponds
with the Greek προφήτης ‘forth-speaker,’ as distinguished from
μάντις or ‘diviner,’ the Babylonian <i>asipu</i>. In Babylonia the <i>asipu</i> performed
the offices which the Hebrew <span lang="hbo"><i>roeh</i></span> had once fulfilled; he determined
whether an army should move or not, whether victory would be
on its side, whether an undertaking would be prosperous or the reverse.
While, therefore, the <i>asipu</i> and the <i>nabiu</i> continued to exist side by side,
performing the functions which had been combined in the Hebrew <i>roeh</i>,
and at the outset in the Hebrew <span lang="hbo"><i>nâbî</i></span>, among the Israelites the <span lang="hbo"><i>roeh</i></span> disappeared,
and the <span lang="hbo"><i>nâbî</i></span> alone remained with purely prophetical attributes.</p>

grew up around him at Ramah, which must have closely resembled the
Dervish colleges of the modern Mohammedan world; see 1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='nineteen'>xix.</abbr> 23.

and one of the histories of the reign of Solomon was contained ‘in the

Isaiah’s history of Hezekiah was called ‘the vision of Isaiah the prophet’

authority as a dispenser of justice. That was confined to a small area in
the heart of Mount Ephraim. Each year, we are told (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='seven'>vii.</abbr> 16) he
went on circuit like a Babylonian judge, ‘to Beth-el and Gilgal and

or Ahiah of Saul, Ahitub will have been the contemporary of Samuel. If
Solomon came to the throne about <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 965, and Saul was about forty
years of age at the time of his death, we should have about <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1045 for
the date of Saul’s birth. Samuel was an old man when he died; if he
lived ten years after Saul’s accession, and was ten years old when the ark
was taken, we may place his birth about <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1090. This would give
about <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>B.C.</span></abbr> 1180 for the birth of Eli, or very shortly after the Israelitish
invasion of Canaan. The life of Eli would thus cover almost the whole
period of the Judges, and form a single link between the Mosaic age and
that of Samuel. In such a case it is not astonishing that the records and
traditions of the Mosaic age were preserved at Shiloh. The ark was only
seven months among the Philistines (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='six'>vi.</abbr> 1), and it was removed
from ‘the house of Abinadab’ at Kirjath-jearim some time after the
seventh year of David (see, however, 1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 18). ‘The sons of

<p class='c003'><span class='label'><a href='#r409'>409</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>The name of Saul corresponds with the Babylonian Savul, a title of
the Sun-god, though it might also be explained as a Hebrew word meaning
‘asked for.’ But one of the Edomite kings was also named Saul, and
he is stated to have come from ‘Rehoboth (Assyrian Rêbit) by the river’
Euphrates (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-six'>xxxvi.</abbr> 37). This points to a Babylonian origin of the
name. Kish, Saul’s father, has also the same name as the Edomite god
Qos (in Assyrian Qaus), of which the Canaanitish Kishon is a derivative.
As Saul’s successors in Edom were Baal-hanan and Hadad, while Hadad
was a contemporary of Solomon, and El-hanan is said in 2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi.</abbr> 19
to have been the slayer of Goliath, I have proposed (<i>The Modern Review</i>,
<abbr title='five'>v.</abbr> 17, 1884) to see in the Saul and Baal-hanan of Edom the Saul and
David of Israel. Saul is said to have fought against Edom (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr>
<abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 47), and Doeg the Edomite was his henchman. But the proposal is
excluded by two facts. The kings of Edom recorded in <abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-six'>xxxvi.</abbr> 31-39
reigned ‘before there was any king over the children of Israel,’ and Saul
the son of Kish did not come from the Euphrates.</p>

of Samuel, and did not know that he was a seer. But the narrative only

When Ahab came to the help of the Syrians against the Assyrian king
Shalmaneser, his whole force consisted of only ten thousand men and two
thousand chariots, and ‘Assur-natsir-pal thinks it a subject of boasting
that he had slain fifty or one hundred and seventy-two of the enemy in
battle.’ The whole of the country population of Judah carried into
captivity by Sennacherib was only two hundred thousand one hundred
and fifty, which would give at most an army of fifty thousand men. The
Egyptian armies, with which the victories of the eighteenth and nineteenth
dynasties were gained, were of small size. One of them, in the time of the
nineteenth dynasty, contained only three thousand one hundred foreign
mercenaries and one thousand nine hundred native troops (Erman, <i>Life in
Ancient Egypt</i>, <abbr title='English translation'>Eng. tr.</abbr>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 542). At the same time, we must not forget
that if there were fifty thousand available fighting men in Judah in the
time of Hezekiah, there would have been about three hundred and fifty
thousand among the other seven tribes a few generations earlier. Consequently
the calculation given in the text of 1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='eleven'>xi.</abbr> 8 is approximately
correct as a mere calculation. Between available and actual fighting men
there was, of course, a great difference. In the second year of Saul’s
reign, when his authority was established, he was not able to muster more
than three thousand fighting men (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='thirteen'>xiii.</abbr> 2). A larger body, indeed,
had flocked to him, but they were an undisciplined, unarmed multitude,
who had to be dismissed to their homes.</p>

numbers of the enemy. The number of chariots is quite impossible, and
they would have been useless in the mountainous country. In the great
battle in which Meneptah saved Egypt from the combined armies of the
Libyans and their northern allies, nine thousand three hundred and
seventy-six prisoners in all were taken, while the slain amounted to six
thousand three hundred and sixty-five Libyans and two thousand three
hundred and seventy of their Mediterranean confederates. To these must
be added nine thousand one hundred and eleven Maxyes. And yet it
does not seem that any of the invaders escaped from the battle.</p>

lasted some time, and was not overthrown at Michmash, as

fabrication, the object of which was to gain a reward from David. There
was this much truth in it, that Saul had been wounded and had desired
death; the Amalekite could easily have learned this from those who had
witnessed the last scene of Saul’s life. But the fact that he had robbed
Saul’s corpse shows that he must have come to the ground after the flight
of the Israelitish soldiers; he was, in fact, one of those Bedâwin thieves

not take part in the battle of Gilboa would suit equally well with either
hypothesis. Abner, the son of Ner, the son of Abiel, was the great-uncle
of Esh-Baal (1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 50, 51). As he was still in the prime of life
when he was murdered, it is reasonable to suppose that his great-nephew
was very young.</p>

alliance with the Ammonites (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'>x.</abbr> 6, etc.), and the king of Ammon
was the ally of David against Esh-Baal (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='eleven'>xi.</abbr> 2). It is probable that

Adonijah, the son of Haggith, who, by the death of his three elder brothers,
became the eldest son before his father’s death, while the fifth and sixth
sons were Shephatiah, the son of Abital, and Ithream, the son of Eglah.

‘Yebosthe the Canaanite is chief of the third; Adino the Asônæan is he
who drew his sword against eight hundred warriors at once’; while the
Chronicler (1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='eleven'>xi.</abbr> 11) omitted the name of Adino, and read:
‘Jashobeam, a Khakmonite, chief of the captains; he lifted up his spear

gives Yesebada. Adino seems to be the Adnah of 1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='twelve'>xii.</abbr> 20, a
Manassite who deserted to David when he was at Ziklag. Jashobeam is
the most probable form of the name, and there must be some confusion
between Jashobeam, who brandished his spear over three hundred enemies,
and an unknown Adino, who did the same over eight hundred enemies.</p>

(1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='eighteen'>xviii.</abbr> 1), and consequently understood <i>ammah</i> in the sense of
‘mother-city.’ My own belief is that we have in the phrase a Hebrew
transcription of a Babylonian expression which has been derived from a
cuneiform document. The Babylonian <i>mêtêg ammati</i> (for <i>mêtêq ammati</i>)
would signify ‘the highroad of the mainland’ of Palestine, and would
refer to the command of the highroad of trade which passed through
Canaan from Asia to Egypt and Arabia. <i>Ammati</i> is the Semitic

those of Mesopotamia, since, as Professor Hommel has shown (<i>Ancient

Ammon, and it is even possible that he may have been the cause of the
Ammonite war. If he had been a rival of his brother Khanun, and had
received shelter and protection from David, we should have an explanation
of the otherwise gratuitous insult offered by Khanun to the ambassadors
of the Israelitish king.</p>

had accused his master of aiming at the kingdom, and David had accordingly
given him all Mephibosheth’s property. David not only had
believed the accusation, but in spite of Mephibosheth’s protests and
excuses, must have continued to do so, since Ziba, so far from being
punished, was allowed to retain half his master’s possessions. The
Jewish historian evidently takes a different view from that of David, and
regards the accusation as false. Mephibosheth is more correctly written
Merib-Baal in 1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 34; <abbr title='nine'>ix.</abbr> 40.</p>

a confusion with the later Sheva (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty'>xx.</abbr> 25). However, the Septuagint
has Sasa in 2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 17, and the two scribes of Solomon at the beginning

<p class='c003'><span class='label'><a href='#r512'>512</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>The genealogy of the high priests is involved in a confusion which with
our present materials it is hopeless to unravel. In 1 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv.</abbr> 3, Ahimelech
is called Ahiah, and in 2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii.</abbr> 17, as well as in the document used in
1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-four'>xxiv.</abbr> (verses 3, 6, and 31), he is made the son of Abiathar instead
of his father. In 1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='eighteen'>xviii.</abbr> 16, the name is transformed into
Abimelech, and in 1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-four'>xxiv.</abbr> Ahimelech and Abiathar are stated to
have been descended from Ithamar the son of Aaron, and not from his
brother Eleazar. That the genealogy in 1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='six'>vi.</abbr> 4 <abbr class='spell'><i>sqq.</i></abbr> is corrupt is
evident not only from the repetition of the triplet Amariah, Ahitub, and
Zadok in verses 7, 8, and 11, 12, but also from the statement that Azariah
four generations after Zadok ‘executed the priest’s office’ in Solomon’s
temple. In 1 <abbr title='Chronicles'>Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='nine'>ix.</abbr> 11; Neh. <abbr title='eleven'>xi.</abbr> 11, again, the order is ‘Zadok the

flight (2 <abbr title='Samuel'>Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='nineteen'>xix.</abbr> 35), the death of David could not have happened very
long after that event. That Joab and Abiathar were still vigorous implies
the same thing. As for the authenticity of David’s dying instructions,
there is no reason to question it. A later writer is not likely to have
gratuitously credited them to David; and inconsistent though they may
seem to us with David’s piety, they were in full keeping with his character
as well as with that of other Israelites of his age. If they had been
falsely ascribed to David by Solomon’s admirers after the murder of
Joab and Shimei, Adonijah also would have been included among the
victims.</p>

place of Azariah as Vizier, Abi the son of Joab being commander-in-chief,
and Ahira the son of Edrei tax-master, while Benaiah remains commander
of the bodyguard as in David’s reign. The list is perhaps derived from
a document that belonged to the early part of Solomon’s reign. The
Syriac reads Zakkur for Zabud, the royal chaplain; but Zabud is supported
by the Vatican Septuagint, which makes him the chief councillor. For

Possibly the two Beth-horons were fortified in connection with the reservoirs
which Solomon is supposed to have constructed in order to supply
Jerusalem with water. Baalath was, strictly speaking, in Dan (<abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='nineteen'>xix.</abbr>

<i>palma</i>, ‘a palm.’ The change of <abbr class='spell'><i>d</i></abbr> to <abbr class='spell'><i>l</i></abbr> in Latin words is familiar to
etymologists, and the initial <abbr class='spell'><i>p</i></abbr> for <abbr class='spell'><i>t</i></abbr> is paralleled by <i>pavo</i>, ‘a peacock,’ from
